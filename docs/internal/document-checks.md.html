# Documenting Lint Checks

Lint ships with a tool to generate documentation pages for lint
checks, both built-in ones as well as third party checks.

You can access the documentation driver directly via a
`java -jar` command, but it's also accessible indirectly via
the “lint” binary, which may be more convenient.

Here's the basic usage:
```shell
Usage: lint-issue-docs-generator [flags] --output <directory or file>]

Flags:

--help                            This message.
--output <dir>                    Sets the path to write the documentation to.
                                  Normally a directory, unless --single-doc is
                                  also specified
--single-doc                      Instead of writing one page per issue into a
                                  directory, write a single page containing
                                  all the issues
--md                              Write to plain Markdown (.md) files instead
                                  of Markdeep (.md.html)
--builtins                        Generate documentation for the built-in
                                  issues. This is implied if --lint-jars is
                                  not specified
--gmaven                          Generate documentation for the lint checks
                                  found on maven.google.com.
--maven-central                   Generate documentation for a few well known
                                  lint libraries distributed on Maven Central.
--lint-jars <jar-path>            Read the lint issues from the specific path
                                  (separated by : of custom jar files
--issues [issues]                 Limits the issues documented to the specific
                                  (comma-separated) list of issue id's
--source-url <url-prefix> <path>  Searches for the detector source code under
                                  the given source folder or folders separated
                                  by semicolons, and if found, prefixes the
                                  path with the given URL prefix and includes
                                  this source link in the issue
                                  documentation.
--test-url <url-prefix> <path>    Like --source-url, but for detector unit
                                  tests instead. These must be named the same
                                  as the detector class, plus `Test` as a
                                  suffix.
--no-index                        Do not include index files
--no-suppress-info                Do not include suppression information
--no-examples                     Do not include examples pulled from unit
                                  tests, if found
--no-links                        Do not include hyperlinks to detector source
                                  code
--no-severity                     Do not include the red, orange or green
                                  informational boxes showing the severity of
                                  each issue
```

(If you get “`-generate-docs does not exist`” you need to use a newer
version of lint.)

## Built-in Checks

Here's a sample invocation, where `$STUDIO` points to the root of the
Android Studio source tree (so `$STUDIO/tools/base/lint/ is the root of
the lint source code).

```shell
$ export LINT_URI_PREFIX=https://cs.android.com/android-studio/platform/tools/base/+/mirror-goog-studio-main:lint/

$ lint \
    --generate-docs \
    --output /tmp/lint-docs/ \
    --builtins \
    --source-url $LINT_URI_PREFIX $STUDIO/tools/base/lint \
    --test-url $LINT_URI_PREFIX $STUDIO/tools/base/lint
```

Here, we use `--source-url` and `--test-url` to not only point the tool
to the right URLs to link to for access to the source code, but also
source locations to search to find the source files, which are then
mined for things like sample unit tests to include as examples in the
documentation.

## Custom Checks

You can generate documentation for third-party checks. To do this, use
the `lint-jars` flag to specify one or more jar file to scan for lint
checks. If your lint check are packaged as an AAR file, you can unzip
this file to find `lint.jar` inside.

## Special Conventions

If you include a test URL search path (and note that the URI prefix is
itself optional (though must be specified as an empty string), so you
could in the built-in example above only have specified `--testurl “”
lint/libs/lint-tests/src/test/java`), lint will search for the
corresponding unit tests. If found, it will try to extract “examples”
to include in the documentation.

This requires that

* The detector tests are located in a class named *Detector*`Test`,
  such as `AlarmDetectorTest` for an issue whose implementation points
  to `AlarmDetector`.

* This class is located in the folder predicted by the package of the
  detector (even though Kotlin lets you place classes wherever you
  want).

* The tests are using lint's test DSL, e.g.
  `lint(files(...)).run().expect(...)`.

* Lint will then try to extract an example from the unit tests. It does
  this by looking at the `expect` output, and if it finds an error with
  the right id, it will then include this error output as well as the
  source file mentioned in the error message as an example (along with
  a message explaining that this test case was automatically
  generated). Lint will only include a single source file (the one
  pointed to by the error message) because we want to keep the example
  straight and to the point, and many unit tests provide a lot of
  “noise” to help make the test complete. For example, for the
  RecyclerView tests, there are stub implementations of the API. There
  are often manifest files and gradle files in tests too which are not
  particularly interesting to the test scenario.

* However, in some cases you really do need to show multiple files to
  illustrate the problem. For example, for the StringFormatDetector,
  which points out an inconsistency between the parameters specified in
  an XML formatting string and the usage from a String.format call in a
  separate Kotlin file, the example really needs to include both.
  Therefore, the documentation tool has support for a “curated”
  example. If you name your unit test `testExample` or `example` or
  `testDocumentationExample`, the tool will include this example, and
  in this case `*all*` the source files and all the error output.

  * Note that if you have a detector which reports multiple issues, you
    can actually suffix the issue id to this name to scope it to the
    specific example, e.g. for “SdCardPath”, the test name could be
    `testDocumentationExampleSdCardPath`.

  * Note also that you can include source files which are omitted from
    the example if the source contains the string
    `HIDE-FROM-DOCUMENTATION` somewhere, typically in a comment. This
    is typically only needed for things like stubs and R classes to
    make the test symbols resolve.

  * By convention, the test class in the example uses the issue id as
    its name when there isn't another obvious choice.

  * To keep examples as short as possible, consider just using the
    default package and even using fully qualified names in some places
    to shorten the import list (as long as it doesn't hinder
    readability for the relevant part of the example.)

  * Consider also adding in some highlighting comment to point out the
    problem. Many lint tests put `// ERROR` as a line suffix for
    statements that produce an error, as well as `// OK` for statements
    that should not (to verify no false positives, though this isn't
    typical useful in an example.)

  * Don't use the manifest DSL for constructing manifest files when
    creating documentation samples; create an explicit manifest XML
    file instead (using `manifest(...)`).

* Similarly, if you have a unit test for suppressing the error, you can
  get this included as an example by naming the test exactly
  `testSuppressExample` or `suppressExample`. Note that this is usually
  not necessary; lint will include generic information about how to
  suppress an element using the applicable mechanisms. But there may be
  cases where the suppression mechanism has some special cases, and in
  that scenario you might want to include an example.

!!! Tip
   If you are developing a new lint check and want to review the
   documentation that will be generated, you can also use the `--issues
   <id>` flag to limit the document generation to just a single check
   (or a comma separated list of checks).
