# Appendix: Environment Variables and System Properties

This chapter lists the various environment variables and system
properties that Lint will look at. None of these are really intended to
be used or guaranteed to be supported in the future, but documenting
what they are seems useful.

## Environment Variables

### Detector Configuration Variables

`ANDROID_LINT_INCLUDE_LDPI`
: Lint's icon checks normally ignore the `ldpi` density since it's not
  commonly used any more, but you can turn this back on with this
  environment variable set to `true`.

`ANDROID_LINT_MAX_VIEW_COUNT`
: Lint's `TooManyViews` check makes sure that a single layout does not
  have more than 80 views. You can set this environment variable to a
  different number to change the limit.

`ANDROID_LINT_MAX_DEPTH`
: Lint's `TooManyViews` check makes sure that a single layout does not
  have a deeper layout hierarchy than 10 levels.You can set this
  environment variable to a different number to change the limit.

`ANDROID_LINT_NULLNESS_IGNORE_DEPRECATED`
: Lint's `UnknownNullness` which flags any API element which is not
  explicitly annotated with nullness annotations, normally skips
  deprecated elements. Set this environment variable to true to include
  these as well.

  Corresponding system property: `lint.nullness.ignore-deprecated`.

  Note that this setting can also be configured using a proper
  `lint.xml` setting instead; this is now listed in the documentation
  for that check.

### Lint Configuration Variables

`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`
: Locates the Android SDK root

`ANDROID_HOME`
: Locates the Android SDK root, if `$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` has not been set

`JAVA_HOME`
: Locates the JDK when lint is analyzing JDK (not Android) projects

`LINT_XML_ROOT`
: Normally the search for `lint.xml` files proceeds upwards in the
  directory hierarchy. In the Gradle integration, the search will stop
  at the root Gradle project, but in other build systems, it can
  continue up to the root directory. This environment variable sets a
  path where the search should stop.

`ANDROID_LINT_JARS`
: A path of jar files (using the path separator -- semicolon on
  Windows, colon elsewhere) for lint to load extra lint checks from

`ANDROID_SDK_CACHE_DIR`
: Sets the directory where lint should read and write its cache files.
  Lint has a number of databases that it caches between invocations,
  such as its binary representation of the SDK API database, used to
  look up API levels quickly. In the Gradle integration of lint, this
  cache directory is set to the root `build/` directory, but elsewhere
  the cache directory is located in a `lint` subfolder of the normal
  Android tooling cache directory, such as `~/.android`.

`LINT_OVERRIDE_CONFIGURATION`
: Path to a lint XML file which should override any local `lint.xml`
  files closer to reported issues. This provides a way to globally
  change configuration.

  Corresponding system property: `lint.configuration.override`

`LINT_DO_NOT_REUSE_UAST_ENV`
: Set to `true` to enable a workaround (if affected) for
  [bug 159733104](https://issuetracker.google.com/159733104)
  until 7.0 is released.

  Corresponding system property: `lint.do.not.reuse.uast.env`

`LINT_API_DATABASE`
: Point lint to an alternative API database XML file instead of the
  normally used `$SDK/platforms/android-?/data/api-versions.xml` file.

`ANDROID_LINT_SKIP_BYTECODE_VERIFIER`
: If set to `true`, lint will *not* perform bytecode verification of custom
  lint check jars from libraries or passed in via command line flags.

  Corresponding system property: `android.lint.skip.bytecode.verifier`

### Lint Development Variables

`LINT_PRINT_STACKTRACE`
: If set to true, lint will print the full stack traces of any internal
  exceptions encountered during analysis. This is useful for authors of
  lint checks, or for power users who can reproduce a bug and want to
  report it with more details.

  Corresponding system property: `lint.print-stacktrace`

`LINT_TEST_KOTLINC`
: When writing a lint check unit test, when creating a `compiled` or
  `bytecode` test file, lint can generate the .class file binary
  content automatically if it is pointed to the `kotlinc` compiler.

`LINT_TEST_JAVAC`
: When writing a lint check unit test, when creating a `compiled` or
  `bytecode` test file, lint can generate the .class file binary
  content automatically if it is pointed to the `javac` compiler.

`INCLUDE_EXPENSIVE_LINT_TESTS`
: When working on lint itself, set this environment variable to `true`
  some really, really expensive tests that we don't want run on the CI
  server or by the rest of the development team.

## System Properties

!!! Tip
   To set system properties when running lint via Gradle, try for
   example `./gradlew lintDebug -Dlint.baselines.continue=true`

`lint.baselines.continue`
: When you configure a new baseline, lint normally fails the build
  after creating the baseline. You can set this system property to true
  to force lint to continue.

`lint.autofix`
: Turns on auto-fixing (applying safe quickfixes) by default. This is a
  shortcut for invoking the `lintFix` targets or running the `lint`
  command with `--apply-suggestions`.

`lint.html.prefs`
: This property allows you to customize lint's HTML reports. It
  consists of a comma separated list of property assignments, e.g.
  `./gradlew :app:lintDebug -Dlint.html.prefs=theme=darcula,window=5`

  Property          |  Explanation and Values                  | Default
  ------------------|------------------------------------------|--------
  `theme`           | `light`, `darcula`, `solarized`          | `light`
  `window`          | Number of lines around problem           | 3
  `maxIncidents`    | Maximum incidents shown per issue type   | 50
  `splitLimit`      | Issue count before “More...” button      | 8
  `maxPerIssue`     | Name of split limit prior to 7.0         | 8
  `underlineErrors` | If true, wavy underlines, else highlight | `true`

`lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests`
: Whether the unused resource check should exclude test sources as
  referenced resources.

`lint.configuration.override`
: Alias for `$LINT_OVERRIDE_CONFIGURATION`

`lint.print-stacktrace`
: Alias for `$LINT_PRINT_STACKTRACE`

`lint.do.not.reuse.uast.env`
: Alias for `$LINT_DO_NOT_REUSE_UAST_ENV`

`android.lint.log-jar-problems`
: Controls whether lint will complain about custom check lint jar
  loading problems. By default, true.

`android.lint.api-database-binary-path`
: Point lint to a precomputed per-SDK platform, per-lint **binary** API
  database to read from. If the file is not found or uses the wrong format
  version, lint will fail.

`android.lint.skip.bytecode.verifier`
: Alias for `$ANDROID_LINT_SKIP_BYTECODE_VERIFIER`

  Corresponding system property: `android.lint.skip.bytecode.verifier`
<!-- Markdeep: --><style class="fallback">body{visibility:hidden;white-space:pre;font-family:monospace}</style><script src="markdeep.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script src="https://morgan3d.github.io/markdeep/latest/markdeep.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script>window.alreadyProcessedMarkdeep||(document.body.style.visibility="visible")</script>
