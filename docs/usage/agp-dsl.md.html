# Lint Gradle Plugin DSL

Lint is integrated into three Gradle plugins:

The `com.android.lint` plugin is the “standalone” lint Gradle plugin
which can be applied to any Kotlin or Java Gradle project. To configure
this project, use a `lint` block to configure it, like this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~groovy
apply plugin: 'kotlin'
apply plugin: 'com.android.lint'

lint {
    htmlOutput = file("lint-report.html")
    textReport = true
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!! Tip
   The lint options block was called `lintOptions` until 7.0. You can
   still refer to it as `lintOptions`, but this was cleaned up as part
   of the Android Gradle Plugin's overhaul of its DSL in 7.0. Another
   7.0 change is that the `lint` task no longer runs lint on all
   variants, but just the default variant -- so you no longer have to
   run `:app:lintDebug` for example -- you can simply run `:app:lint`.

The `com.android.library` and `com.android.application` plugins for
Android development bundles in the lint support. They register a lint
task for each variant, as well as a task named `lint` which runs the
default variant's lint task.

To configure lint for Android, place the `lint` block within the
`android` block:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~groovy
android {
    lint {
        htmlOutput = file("lint-report.html")
        textReport = true
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Configuring Issues and Severity

`ignoreWarnings` *true or false*
: Whether lint should only report errors. False by default.

`checkAllWarnings` *true or false*
: Whether lint should check all issues, including those that are marked
  off by default. *False by default.*

`warningsAsErrors` *true or false*
: Whether lint should treat all warnings as errors. False by default.

`disable` *issue-list*
: List of issue id's that lint should ignore.

  Example: `disable 'TypographyFractions','TypographyQuotes'`.

`enable` *issue-list*
: List of issues disabled by default that lint should enable.

  Example: `enable 'RtlHardcoded','RtlCompat', 'RtlEnabled'`.

`checkOnly` *issue-list*
: If any issues are listed as `checkOnly`, then **all** other issues
  are disabled and only those specific issues will be analyzed.

  Example: `checkOnly 'NewApi', 'InlinedApi'`.

`fatal` issue-list
: Sets the severity of the given issues to “fatal” (which means they
  will be checked during release builds (even if the lint target is not
  included).

  Example: `fatal 'NewApi', 'InlineApi'`

`error` issue-list
: Sets the severity of the given issues to error.

  Example: `error 'Wakelock', 'TextViewEdits'`

`warning` issue-list
: Sets the severity of the given issues to warning.

  Example: `warning 'ResourceAsColor'`

`ignore` issue-list
: Sets the severity of the given issues to ignore (same as disabling
  the check).

  Example: `ignore 'ResourceAsColor'`

`informational` issue-list
: Sets the severity of the given issues to informational, which is
  basically a tip.

  Example: `informational 'StopShip'`

## Configuring Output and Reports

`absolutePaths` *true or false*
: Whether lint should include full paths to files in the error reports.
  If false, paths will be made relative to each module directory.
  *True by default.*

`noLines` *true or false*
: Whether lint should include showing snippets of the source code along
  with underlines to show the line of code containing the problem.
  *False by default (note the negated name of the flag).*

`showAll` *true or false*
: Whether lint should show **all** locations (for issues that have
  multiple locations, such as showing each duplicate declaration of a
  resources), whether it should not truncate lists, etc.

`explainIssues` *true or false*
: Whether lint should include a full issue explanations paragraphs in
  the text error output. Note that this only applies for text reports;
  HTML and XML reports will always contain explanations.
  *False by default.*

`textReport` *true or false*
: Whether lint should generate a text report. If you don't specify a
  location using `textOutput`, lint will default to
  `lint-results-`*$variant*`.txt` in $module`/build/reports/, such as
  `app/build/reports/lint-results-debug.txt`.

`textOutput` file or `'stdout'` or `'stderr'`
: Where lint should write its text output; either a file, or one of
  the two magic strings `stdout` or `stderr`, which writes to the
  standard output or standard error streams respectively. In recent
  versions of lint, this will also imply `textReport true`.

  Example: `textOutput file(“$buildDir/reports/lint-results.txt”)`

`xmlReport` *true or false*
: Whether lint should generate an XML report. If you don't specify a
  location using `xmlOutput`, lint will default to
  `lint-results-`*$variant*`.xml` in $module`/build/reports/, such as
  `app/build/reports/lint-results-debug.xml`.

`xmlOutput file("$buildDir/reports/lint-report.xml")`
: Where lint should write its XML report. In recent versions of lint,
  this will also imply `xmlReport true`.

  Example: `xmlOutput file("$buildDir/reports/lint-results.xml")`

`htmlReport` *true or false*
: Whether lint should generate an HTML report, with issue explanations,
  code snippets, etc. If you don't specify a location using
  `htmlOutput`, lint will default to `lint-results-`*$variant*`.html`
  in $module`/build/reports/, such as
  `app/build/reports/lint-results-debug.html`.

`htmlOutput` file
: Where lint should write its HTML report;. In recent versions of lint,
  this will also imply `htmlReport true`. See also the [variables
  chapter](variables.md.html) for some flags to configure the HTML
  report.

  Example: `htmlOutput file(“$buildDir/reports/lint-results.html”)`

`sarifReport` *true or false*
: Whether lint should generate a
  [SARIF](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.0/sarif-v2.0.html)
  report for use by for example GitHub. If you don't specify a location
  using `sarifOutput`, lint will default to
  `lint-results-`*$variant*`.sarif` in $module`/build/reports/, such as
  `app/build/reports/lint-results-debug.sarif`.

`sarifOutput` file
: Where lint should write its HTML SARIF. In recent versions of lint,
  this will also imply `sarifReport true`.

  Example: `sarifOutput file("$buildDir/reports/lint-report.sarif.json")`

`quiet` *true or false*
: Whether lint should limit its diagnostic output. *False by default.*

## Files to Include

`checkGeneratedSources` *true or false*
: Normally lint will skip generated sources, but you can turn it on
  with this flag. *False by default.*

`checkTestSources` *true or false*
: Normally most lint checks are not run on test sources (except the
  checks dedicated to looking for mistakes in unit or instrumentation
  tests, unless ignoreTestSources is true). You can turn on normal lint
  checking in all sources with this flag. *False by default.*

`ignoreTestSources` *true or false*
: Like `checkTestSources`, but tells lint to always skip analyzing
  tests -- meaning that it also ignores checks that have explicitly
  asked to look at test sources, such as the unused resource check.
  *False by default.*

`checkDependencies` *true or false*
: Normally lint will analyze all dependencies along with each module;
  this ensures that lint can correctly (for example) determine if a
  resource declared in a library is unused; checking only the library
  in isolation would not be able to identify this problem. It also
  gives you a single cumulative report for the entire project, which is
  easier to digest. However, in older versions of lint this led to
  performance problems. *False by default, but will soon switch to true
  by default.*

## Other

`baseline` file
: Configures a [baseline](baselines.md.html). The first time lint is
  run, and the baseline file does not exist, it will record all the
  current violations into this file (which can be checked into version
  control). On subsequent runs, only newly introduced issues (not found
  in the baseline) will be reported.

  Example: `baseline file("lint-baseline.xml")`

`lintConfig ` *file*
: Sets a [lint XML file](lintxml.md.html) to use as a fallback
  configuration. Avoid calling this file `lint.xml` to avoid
  ambiguity, since those files are automatically loaded.

  Example: `lintConfig file("default-lint.xml")`

`abortOnError` *true or false*
: If true, stops the Gradle build if one or more errors are found.
  *True by default.*

`checkReleaseBuilds` *true or false*
: If true, include lint analysis in release builds (such as
  `assembleRelease`), but limited to issues with severity configured to
  be `fatal`, and abort the build if any fatal issues are found (unless
  `abortOnError` is set to false). *True by default.*

!!! Tip
   The `DataFlowAnalyzer` received a number of really important fixes
   in 7.0, so if you are testing with older versions of lint, some of
   the features described above (such as proper support for Kotlin
   scoping functions) will not work correctly.
