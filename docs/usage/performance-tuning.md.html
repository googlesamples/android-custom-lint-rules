# Performance Tuning

Lint tends to get slower for every release. There's a reason for that:
It keeps checking more and more things (as of 7.0 canary we're up to
around 400 separate issues), and existing issues are often made more
complex as well, doing deeper flow and data analysis, and occasionally
there are new features which also add costs, such as baselines, Kotlin
analysis, etc. And this is all compounded by the codebases lint is
getting run on also growing bigger and bigger, and being broken up into
more and more modules.

This chapter provides some tips on how to improve the performance of
lint on CI servers.

!!! Tip
   Some of these suggestions are not true in all cases, so you might
   want to time before and after to verify that for your project each
   change is an improvement.

## Use 7.0 and Incremental Lint

In 7.0, lint will finally be capable of running incrementally across
modules, meaning that if you change code in just one module, lint will
only have to rerun analysis on modules downstream from that module.
With large projects with many modules, this should be a significant
improvement.

To use this:

1. Update to the latest 7.0 canary 12 or later.

2. Update your CI configuration such that it does not clean the working
   directories between each build.

We are working on making the state files used by this mechanism path
relative such that this facility will also work for Gradle's remote
cache; once that's done, this will work for clean builds as well.

## Use the `lintDebug` target, not `lint`

If you run “./gradlew tasks” you'll see that there's a `lint` task, and
you may be tempted to run it. But lint also adds specific tasks for
each variant. For example, if you only have “debug” and “release”
variants (e.g. you haven't defined any product flavors or additional
build types), lint will create 3 targets:

* `lint`
* `lintDebug`
* `lintRelease`

If you have defined additional build types or product flavors, you can
end up with many more of these -- `lintFreeDebug`, `lintProDebug`,
`lintFreeBeta`, `lintProBeta`, etc.

**Don't configure your CI job to run the `lint` task; pick a specific
variant instead, such as `lintDebug`**. The reason this is so
important, is that what the `lint` task really does is run lint over
and over again, for *each* variant, and then it collates the results in
the end! It combines all the errors it found, and shows which specific
variants every error applies to, unless it applies to all (which is
nearly always the case).

The rationale for this behavior is that you could have a
variant-specific issue; for example, you may have a resource file which
is only present in a variant-specific source set (such as
`src/debug/res/values`), so the general lint target checks everything.
Of course, you're probably only shipping your release variant, so you
could limit yourself to just running `lintRelease` and you're not going
to miss much.

!!! Note
   You're probably shipping your release variant, not your debug
   variant, so instead of running `lintDebug` it's probably more
   accurate to run `lintRelease`. However, unless you're doing anything
   variant specific, it's unlikely that this matters, and running
   `lintRelease` can take significantly longer since it performs more
   build time optimizations.

If you have lots of variants this makes a huge difference; with 7
variants, `lint` will take ~7x longer than `lintDebug` !! (modulo some
minor caching)

!!! Tip
   In 7.0 and Arctic Fox we're changing the behavior of the `lint`
   target such that it is just an alias for `lintDebug`, so once you
   update to 7.0 this is no longer a problem.

## Only analyze app/leaf modules

If you have divided your project into many smaller modules - a number
of libraries and just a couple of app modules, it's much better to

1. Turn on checkDependencies mode, and

2. Only run lint on the app modules, instead of recursively running
   lint on each module.

To do this, first add this to your app module's build.gradle file:

```
android {
    ...
    lintOptions {
        ...
        checkDependencies true
        ...
    }
}
```

Then instead of running `./gradlew lintDebug`, run `./gradlew
:app:lintDebug`.

Since you've turned on check-dependencies mode, running lint on the app
module will also run it on all the dependent modules the app depends on
-- e.g. all the libraries. But this should also make things run a lot
faster, since it's a single lint invocation, where lint shares a lot
more computation (such as symbol resolution in the SDK and various
shared libraries, etc).

!!! Note
   Note that `checkDependencies true` will also cause lint to analyze
   Kotlin-only or Java-only modules, which the normal `./gradlew
   lintDebug` approach will not do, since that just invokes lint on
   modules that apply the Android plugins. This is actually a good
   thing since that code does get included in your Android app and lint
   has a number of checks that are relevant for that code. But note
   that this analysis isn't free, so it's technically possible that in
   some cases (if you have a lot of these modules relative to the
   number of Android modules) lint will not actually run faster with
   `checkDependencies true`. However, for this scenario it's probably a
   change you want to make anyway.

This isn't just a good idea from a performance perspective; you'll also
get more accurate results. For example, the unused resource analysis
will now correctly know whether a resource defined in a library is
consumed by the app module; that doesn't happen when you run lint first
on the library, and later on just the app, which is what happens when
you run `./gradlew lintDebug`. As a bonus you'll also get a single HTML
report containing all the results from your codebase, instead of having
to hunt around the tree for all the various reports and look at each
one separately.

!!! Note
   This mode used to be on by default, since it has better usability.
   We had to turn it off for performance reasons, because many users
   were running redundant targets. But in 7.0 we've added a new
   mechanism (partial analysis) which solves these performance
   problems, so we will most likely turn this mode back on by default.

## Don't analyze test sources

Lint has two flags controlling what to do about test sources:
`checkTestSources` and `ignoreTestSources`. These mean different things.

The `checkTestSources` option controls whether lint should run all the
normal checks on the test sources. This is already off by default, so
there's really no performance reason to tweak it. The only reason you'd
turn this on is if you really want to make sure your test sources are
pristine as well. The `ignoreTestSources` option on the other hand
controls whether lint should really ignore all test sources. Even if
lint doesn't run normal checks on the test sources, it still has to
include them in analysis for some of the regular lint checks for
production code. For example, what if you have a resource which is only
referenced from a test; do you then want to flag this as unused when
the test is still referencing it?

Add the following to your app module's `build.gradle` file to tell lint
to completely ignore your test sources, which should help lint run
faster since (for well tested code) this can help skip a lot of code
analysis and type resolution:

```
android {
    ...
    lintOptions {
        ...
        ignoreTestSources true
        ...
    }
}
```

## Don't use checkAllWarnings

Lint has a `checkAllWarnings` option you can use to turn on checking of
all warnings, including those that are off by default. This flag is off
by default, but some developers turn it on (*“because I want all the
tips I can get”* is what I heard from one developer).

Be careful doing that, because some of the disabled checks are slow,
and some have a lot of false positives which is why they're off by
default but available if you really want to audit for one specific
problem. (In older versions this would also turn on the
`WrongThreadInterprocedural` check, which is particularly expensive,
though in recent versions we've specifically exempted this check from
`checkAllWarnings`.)

## Use latest version

Try using the latest versions of lint (the Android Gradle plugin), as
well as of Gradle -- even if that means using a canary version. Yes, by
all means, for your production builds use a stable version of the
Gradle plugin to build your release APK/bundle, but for your CI server,
consider running the latest preview version of lint, since generally
those versions will have the most up to date fixes. (Yes, regressions
happen and canaries go through less testing, but in general lint has
really good coverage so regressions do not happen very often.)

## Give lint a lot of RAM

This one is kind of obvious, but lint (especially the code analysis
part) is really memory hungry; it does a lot of the same work as a
compiler, except that it also hangs on to a lot more data (e.g. the
full ASTs with whitespace and comments etc). Explore bumping up the
memory given to the Gradle daemon significantly to see if it helps
bring down the overall analysis time.

This is *especially* important if you happen to run many lint jobs in
parallel! If you follow the advice above (where you're running a single
lint job with recursive dependencies on the app module) this is less
likely to happen, but I've seen various thread dumps from users asking
about performance where there was 16-20 concurrent separate lint jobs
running in the Gradle daemon, and each one requires a lot of memory;
these separate lint job threads are not sharing data.

One user reported this result:

> I have a very large project (with over 2000 classes) and giving lint
> more memory had a huge effect:
>
> `./gradlew -Dorg.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2g app:lintDebug` takes 25m 18s
>
> `./gradlew -Dorg.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx8g app:lintDebug` takes 8m 57s!

## Finding Slow Lint Checks

We have a tool we use to try to attribute the time spent during
analysis to individual lint checks. When analysis is taking longer
than expected, we run this tool to see if any of the lint checks
are misbehaving. Here's some sample output:

```
$ ./gradlew lintDebug -no-daemon -Dorg.gradle.jvmargs="..."

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 10s

Lint detector performance stats:
                                     total           self          calls

```
Here you can see that `InvalidPackageDetector` is taking up an
unreasonable amount of time. And this is actually real output from an
earlier version of lint where we tracked down a real problem in that
detector.

You can read more about this tool in [this
post](https://groups.google.com/g/lint-dev/c/mwpTCaQPXYU/m/YKc4EcMYAgAJ).

If you see a suspicious check, you can try to disable its issues
(unless you find their value is worth the cost; after all, real world
bugs are typically more expensive than server compute cycles.) But
don't forget to also report the bug to the lint check author!

!!! Warning
   One thing to be aware of is that the “blame” is not entirely fair.
   There are a number of expensive operations in lint, and especially
   symbol resolution, which is cached. That means that the first
   unlucky detector that comes along has to perform the computation,
   and subsequent detectors just get to reuse the result. Because of
   this, it's not always the case that a particular detector is a
   performance culprit, and as soon as you disable it, a new detector
   moves to the top of the list paying the same initialization costs.
   The main use for this tool is to find extreme or unusual performance
   behaviors.
