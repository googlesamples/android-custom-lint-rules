**Recent Changes**

This chapter lists recent changes to lint that affect users of lint.
For information about internal improvements and API changes affecting
lint check authors, see the API Guide.

**7.0**

* New built-in lint checks:

  Issue ID                         | Summary
  ---------------------------------|-----------------------------------
  `AnnotateVersionCheck`           | Annotate SDK_INT checks
  `CoarseFineLocation`             | Cannot use `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` without `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`
  `CustomSplashScreen`             | Application-defined Launch Screen
  `CustomX509TrustManager`         | Implements custom TLS trust manager
  `HighSamplingRate`               | High sensor sampling rate
  `IntentFilterExportedReceiver`   | Unspecified `android:exported` in manifest
  `LaunchActivityFromNotification` | Notification Launches Services or BroadcastReceivers
  `LeanbackUsesWifi`               | Using android.hardware.wifi on TV
  `MediaCapabilities`              | Media Capabilities property not specified
  `NotificationTrampoline`         | Notification Trampolines
  `NotifyDataSetChanged`           | Invalidating All RecyclerView Data
  `TileProviderPermissions`        | TileProvider does not set permission
  `TrustAllX509TrustManager`       | Insecure TLS/SSL trust manager
  `UnspecifiedImmutableFlag`       | Missing `PendingIntent` mutability flag
  `WatchFaceEditor`                | Watch face editor must use launchMode=“standard”

* Lint checks now include information for reported incidents where the
  lint check came from, such as which library artifact provided it.
  This should make it easier to request enhancements or file bugs
  around false positives or false negatives.

* Lint “partial analysis” mode is now integrated in lint. It is
  enabled by default, but you can disable it by modifying
  `gradle.properties` to include

      `android.enableParallelLint=false`

* The API check now also looks up operator overloading functions.

**4.2**

* Improved support for lint.xml configuration files. You can now
  specify lint.xml files in project source folders, where the settings
  will apply recursively within just that folder. You can also specify
  options for detectors, and enable or disable checks for specific
  clients (such as just in Gradle, or just in the IDE, and so on.)

* Support for SARIF reports; a static analysis report file format
  supported by for example GitHub, allowing the results to be
  visualized in a unified way on CI servers.
