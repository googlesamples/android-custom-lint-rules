# Configuring Using lint.xml Files

In addition to configuring lint with command line flags or Gradle DSL
options, you can also create XML files named `lint.xml`, which lint
will look for automatically.

Like `.gitignore` files, these can be nested, so you can for example
create a `lint.xml` file which sets the severity of an issue to error,
but then in a specific subfolder change the severity to be just a
warning.

This chapter describes the syntax of `lint.xml` files.

## XML Syntax

The root tag is always `<lint>`, and it can contain one or more
`<issue>` elements. Each <issue> can specify the following
attributes: `id`: The issue id the following configuration applies
to. Note that this can be a comma separated list of multiple id's, in
which case the configuration applies to all of them. It can also be
the special value “all”, which will match all issue id's. And when
configuring severity, the id is also allowed to be a category, such
as “Security”.

`in`: Specifies that this configuration only applies when lint
runs in the given hosts. There are predefined names for various
integrations of lint; “gradle” refers to lint running in the Gradle
plugin; “studio” refers to lint running in the IDE, “cli” refers to
lint running from the command line tools “lint” binary, etc. Like
with id's, this can be a comma separated list, which makes the rule
match if the lint host is any of the listed hosts. Finally, note that
you can also add a “!” in front of each host to negate the check. For
example, to enable a check anywhere except when running in Studio,
use `in="!studio"`.

In addition, the <issue> element can specify one or more children:

`<ignore path="...">`: Specifies a path to ignore. Can contain the
globbing character “*” to match any substring in the path. `<ignore
regexp="...">`: Specifies either a regular expression to ignore. The
regular expression is matched against both the location of the error
and the error message itself. `<option name="..." value="...">`:
Specifies an option value. This can be used to configure some lint
checks with options.

Finally, on the root <lint> element you can specify a number of
attributes, such as `lintJars` (a list of jar files containing custom
lint checks, separated by a semicolon as a path separator), and
flags like warningsAsErrors, checkTestSources, etc (matching most
of the flags offered via the lintOptions block in Gradle files.)

## Nesting & Precedence

You can specify configurations for “all”, but these will be
matched after an exact match has been done. E.g. if we have
both `<issue id="all" severity="ignore">` and `<issue id="MyId"
severity="error">`, the severity for `MyId` will be “error”“ since
that's a more exact match.

The lint.xml files can be nested in a directory structure, and when
lint reports an error, it looks up the closest lint.xml file, and
if no configuration is found there, continues searching upwards in
the directory tree. This means that the configuration closest to the
report location takes precedence. Note however, that this has higher
priority than the above all versus id match, so if there is an `all`
match in a `lint.xml` file and an exact match in a more distant
parent `lint.xml` file, the closest `lint.xml` all match will be
used.

When there are configurations which specify a host, lint will search
in this order:
1. An exact host match. E.g. if you're running in Studio and there is
   an `<issue>` configuration which specifies
   `in="studio"`, then that configuration will be used.
2. A match which does not specify a host. Usually `<issue>`
   configurations do not specify a host,
   and these will be consulted next.
3. A match which specifies other hosts. For example, if you're
   running in Studio and a configuration specifies
   ”!gradle“, this will match after the other attempts.

## Sample lint.xml file

Typically lint.xml files are pretty short and simple, but here's
one which uses most of the available features. (Note: the
HTML version of this isn't properly handling empty elements,
so if you're going to copy/paste go to the source file.)
