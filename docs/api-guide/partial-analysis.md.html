# Partial Analysis

## About

This chapter describes Lint's “partial analysis”; its architecture and
APIs for allowing lint results to be cached.

This focuses on how to write or update existing lint checks such that
they work correctly under partial analysis. For other details about
partial analysis, such as the client side implemented by the build
system, see the lint internal docs folder.

!!! Note
   Note that while lint has this architecture, and all lint detectors
   must support it, the checks may not run in partial analysis mode;
   they may instead run in “global analysis mode”, which is how lint
   has worked up until this point.

   This is because coordinating partial results and merging is
   performed by the `LintClient`; e.g. in the IDE, there's no good
   reason to do all this extra work (because all sources are generally
   available, including “downstream” module info like the
   `minSdkVersion`).

   Right now, only the Android Gradle Plugin turns on partial analysis
   mode. But that's a very important client, since it's usually how
   lint checks are performed on continuous integration servers to
   validate code reviews.

## The Problem

Many lint checks require “global” analysis. For example you can't
determine whether a particular string defined in a library module is
unused unless you look at all modules transitively consuming this
library as well.

However, many developers run lint as part of their continuous
integration. Particularly in large projects, analyzing all modules for
every check-in is too costly.

This chapter describes lint's architecture for handling this, such
that module results can be cached.

## Overview

Briefly stated, lint's architecture for this is “map reduce”: lint now
has two separate phases, analyze and report (map and reduce
respectively):

* **analyze** - where lint analyzes source code of a single module in
  isolation, and stores some intermediate partial results (map)

* **report** - where lint reads in the previously stored module results,
  and performs some post-processing on this data to generate an actual
  lint report.

Crucially, the individual module results can be cached, such that if
nothing has changed in a module, the module results continue to be
valid (unless signatures have changed in libraries it depends on.)

Making this work requires some modifications to any `Detector` which
considers data from outside the current module. However, there are some
very common scenarios that lint has special support for to make this
easier.

Detectors fit into one of the following categories (and these
categories will be explained in subsequent sessions) :

1. Local analysis which doesn't depend on anything else. For example,
   a lint check which flags typos can report incidents immediately.
   Lint calls these “definite incidents”.

2. Local analysis which depends on a few, common conditions. For
   example, in Android, a check may only apply if the `minSdkVersion <
   21`. Lint has special support for this; you basically report an
   incident and attach a “constraint” to it. Lint calls these, and
   incidents reported as part of #3 below, as “provisional incidents”.

3. Analysis which depends on some conditions of downstream modules that
   are not part of the built-in constraints. For example, a lint check
   may only apply if the consuming module depends on a certain version
   of a networking library. In this case, the detector will report the
   incident and attach a map to it, with whatever data it needs to
   consult later to decide if the incident actually should be reported.
   When the detector reports incidents this way, it has to also
   override a callback method. Lint will record these incidents, and
   during reporting, call the detector and pass it back its data map
   and provisional incidents such that it can decide whether the
   incidents should indeed be reported.

4. Last, and least, there are some scenarios where you cannot compute
   provisional incidents up front and filter them later (or doing so
   would be very costly). For example, unused resources fit into this
   category. We don't want to report every single resource declaration
   as unused and then filter later. Instead, we compute the resource
   usage graph within the module analysis. And in the reporting task,
   we then load all the partial usage graphs, and merge them together
   and walk the graph to report all the unused resources. To support
   this, lint provides a map per module for detectors to put their data
   into, and you can put maps into the map to model structured data.
   Lint will persist these, and in the reporting task the lint
   detectors will be passed their data to do their post-processing and
   reporting based on their data.

These are listed in increasing order of effort, and thankfully, they're
also listed in order of frequency. For lint's built-in checks (~385),

* 89% needed no work at all.
* 6% were updated to report incidents with constraints
* 4% were updated to report incidents with data for later filtering
* 1% were updated to perform map recording and later reduce filtering

## Does My Detector Need Work?

At this point you're probably wondering whether your checks are in the
89% category where you don't need to do anything, or in the remaining
11%. How do you know?

Lint has several built-in mechanisms to try to catch problems. There
are a few scenarios it cannot detect, and these are described below,
but for the vast majority, simply running your unit tests (which are
comprehensive, right?) should create unit test failures if your
detector is doing something it shouldn't.

### Catching Mistakes: Blocking Access to Main Project

In Android checks, it's very common to try to access the main (“app”)
project, to see what the real `minSdkVersion` is, since the app
`minSdkVersion` can be higher than the one in the library. For the
`targetSdkVersion` it's even more important, since the library
`targetSdkVersion` has no meaningful relationship to the app one.

When you run lint unit tests, as of 7.0, it will now run your tests
twice -- once with global analysis (the previous behavior), and once
with partial analysis. When lint is running in partial analysis, a
number of calls, such as looking up the main project, or consulting the
merged manifest, is not allowed during the analysis phase. Attempting
to do so will generate an error:

```none
    SdCardTest.java: Error: The lint detector
        com.android.tools.lint.checks.SdCardDetector
    called context.getMainProject() during module analysis.

    This does not work correctly when running in Lint Unit Tests.

    In particular, there may be false positives or false negatives because
    the lint check may be using the minSdkVersion or manifest information
    from the library instead of any consuming app module.

    Contact the vendor of the lint issue to get it fixed/updated (if
    known, listed below), and in the meantime you can try to work around
    this by disabling the following issues:

    "SdCardPath"

    Issue Vendor:
    Vendor: Android Open Source Project
    Contact: https://groups.google.com/g/lint-dev
    Feedback: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=192708

        ←UVariableKt.access$visitContents(UVariable.kt:1)←UField$DefaultImpls.accept(UVariable.kt:92)
        ...
```

Specific examples of information many lint checks look at in this
category:
* `minSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion`
* The merged manifest
* The resource repository
* Whether the main module is an Android project

### Catching Mistakes: Simulated App Module

Lint will also modify the unit test when running the test in partial
analysis mode. In particular, let's say your test has a manifest which
sets `minSdkVersion` to 21.

Lint will instead run the analysis task on a modified test project
where the `minSdkVersion` is set to 1, and then run the reporting task
where `minSdkVersion` is set back to 21. This ensures that lint checks
will correctly use the `minSdkVersion` from the main project, not the
library.

### Catching Mistakes: Diffing Results

Lint will also diff the report output from running the same unit tests
both in global analysis mode and in partial analysis mode. We expect
the results to always be identical, and in some cases if the module
analysis is not written correctly, they're not.

### Catching Mistakes: Remaining Issues

The above three mechanisms will catch most problems related to partial
analysis. However, there are a few remaining scenarios to be aware of:

* Resolving into library source code. If you have a Kotlin or Java
  function call AST node (`UCallExpression`) you can call `resolve()`
  on it to find the called `PsiMethod`, and from there you can look at
  its source code, to make some decisions.

  For example, lint's API Check uses this to see if a given method is a
  version-check utility (“`SDK_INT > 21`?”); it resolves the method
  call in `if (isOnLollipop()) { ... }` and looks at its method body to
  see if the return value corresponds to a proper `SDK_INT` check.

  In partial analysis mode, you cannot look at source files from
  libraries you depend on; they will only be provided in binary
  (bytecode inside a jar file) form.

  This means that instead, you need to aggregate data along the way.
  For example, the way lint handles the version check method lookup is
  to look for SDK_INT comparisons, and if found, stores a reference to
  the method in the partial results map which it can later consult
  from downstream modules.

* Multiple passes across the modules (lint has a way to request
  multiple passes; this was used by a few lint checks like the unused
  resource detector; the multiple passes now only apply to the local
  module)

In order to test for correct operation of your check, you should add
your own individual unit test for a multi-module project.

Lint's unit test infrastructure makes this easy; just use relative
paths in the test file descriptions.

For example, if you have the following unit test declaration:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin linenumbers
   lint().files(
       manifest().minSdk(15),
       manifest().to("../app/AndroidManifest.xml").minSdk(21),
       xml(
           "res/layout/linear.xml",
           "<LinearLayout ...>" + ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The second `manifest()` call here on line 3 does all the heavy lifting:
the fact that you're referencing `../app` means it will create another
module named “app”, and it will add a dependency from that module on
this one. It will also mark the current module as a library. This is
based on the name patterns; if you for example reference say `../lib1`,
it will assume the current module is an app module and the dependency
will go from here to the library.

Finally, to test a multi-module setup where the code in the other
module is only available as binary, lint has a new special test file
type. The `CompiledSourceFile` can be constructed via either
`compiled()`, if you want to make both the source code and the class
file available in the project, or `bytecode()` if you want to only
provide the bytecode. In both cases you include the source code in the
test file declaration, and the first time you run your test it will try
to run compilation and emit the extra base64 string to include the test
file. By having the sources included for the binary it's easy to
regenerate bytecode tests later (this was an issue with some of lint's
older unit tests; we recently decompiled them and created new test
files using this mechanism to make the code more maintainable.

Lint's partial analysis testing support will automatically only use
binaries for the dependencies (even if using `CompiledSourceFile` with
sources).

!!! Note
   Lint's testing infrastructure may try to automate this testing at
   some point; e.g. by looking at the error locations from a global
   analysis, it can then create a new project where only the source
   file with the warnings is provided as source, and all the other test
   files are placed in a separate module, and then represented only as
   binaries (through a lint AST to PsiCompiled pretty printer.)

## Incidents

In the past, you would typically report problems like this:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin linenumbers
    context.report(
        ISSUE,
        element,
        context.getNameLocation(element),
        "Missing `contentDescription` attribute on image"
    )
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At some point, we added support for quickfixes, so the
report method took an additional parameter, line 6:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin linenumbers
    context.report(
        ISSUE,
        element,
        context.getNameLocation(element),
        "Missing `contentDescription` attribute on image",
        fix().set().todo(ANDROID_URI, ATTR_CONTENT_DESCRIPTION).build()
)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that we need to attach various additional data (like constraints
and maps), we don't really want to just add more parameters.

Instead, this tuple of data about a particular occurrence of a problem
is called an “incident”, and there is a new `Incident` class which
represents it. To report an incident you simply call
`context.report(incident)`. There are several ways to create these
incidents. The easiest is to simply edit your existing call above by
adding `Incident(` (or from Java, `new Incident(`) inside the
`context.report` block like this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
    context.report(Incident(
        ISSUE,
        element,
        context.getNameLocation(element),
        "Missing `contentDescription` attribute on image"
    ))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

and then reformatting the source code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
    context.report(
        Incident(
            ISSUE,
            element,
            context.getNameLocation(element),
            "Missing `contentDescription` attribute on image"
        )
)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Incident` has a number of overloaded constructors to make it easy to
construct it from existing report calls.

There are other ways to construct it too, for example like the
following:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
    Incident(context)
        .issue(ISSUE)
        .scope(node)
        .location(context.getLocation(node))
        .message("Do not hardcode \"/sdcard/\"").report()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That are additional methods you can fall too, like `fix()`, and
conveniently, `at()` which specifies not only the scope node but
automatically computes and records the location of that scope node too,
such that the following is equivalent:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
    Incident(context)
        .issue(ISSUE)
        .at(node)
        .message("Do not hardcode \"/sdcard/\"").report()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So step one to partial analysis is to convert your code to report
incidents instead of the passing in all the individual properties of an
incident. Note that for backwards compatibility, if your check doesn't
need any work for partial analysis, you can keep calling the older
report methods; they will be redirected to an `Incident` call
internally, but since you don't need to attach data you don't have to
make any changes

## Constraints

If your check needs to be conditional, perhaps on the `minSdkVersion`,
you need to attach a “constraint” to your report call.

All the constraints are built in; there isn't a way to implement your
own. For custom logic, see the next section: LintMaps.

Here are the current constraints, though this list may grow over time:

* minSdkAtLeast(Int)
* minSdkLessThan(Int)
* targetSdkAtLeast(Int)
* targetSdkLessThan(Int)
* isLibraryProject()
* isAndroidProject()
* notLibraryProject()
* notAndroidProject()

These are package-level functions, though from Java you can access them
from the `Constraints` class.

Recording an incident with a constraint is easy; first construct the
`Incident` as before, and then report them via
`context.report(incident, constraint)`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~java
    String message =
        "One or more images in this project can be converted to "
        + "the WebP format which typically results in smaller file sizes, "
        + "even for lossless conversion";
    Incident incident = new Incident(WEBP_ELIGIBLE, location, message);
    context.report(incident, minSdkAtLeast(18));
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, note that you can combine constraints; there are both “and”
and “or” operators defined for the `Constraint` class. so the following
is valid:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
    val constraint = targetSdkAtLeast(23) and notLibraryProject()
    context.report(incident, constraint)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That's all you have to do. Lint will record this provisional incident,
and when it is performing reporting, it will evaluate these constraints
on its own and only report incidents that meet the constraint.

## Incident LintMaps

In some cases, you cannot use one of the built-in constraints; you have
to do your own “filtering” from the reporting task, where you have
access to the main module.

In that case, you call `context.report(incident, map)` instead.

Like `Incident`, `LintMap` is a new data holder class in lint which
makes it convenient to pass around (and more importantly, persist)
data. All the set methods return the map itself, so you can easily
chain property calls.

Here's an example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
    context.report(
        incident,
        map()
            .put(KEY_OVERRIDES, overrides)
            .put(KEY_IMPLICIT, implicitlyExportedPreS)
    )
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here, `map()` is a method defined by `Detector` to create a new
`LintMap`, similar to how `fix()` constructs a new `LintFix`.

Note however that when reporting data, you need to do the post
processing yourself. To do this, you need to override this method:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
    /**
     * Filter which looks at incidents previously reported via
     * [Context.report] with a [LintMap], and returns false if the issue
     * does not apply in the current reporting project context, or true
     * if the issue should be reported. For issues that are accepted,
     * the detector is also allowed to mutate the issue, such as
     * customizing the error message further.
     */
    open fun filterIncident(context: Context, incident: Incident, map: LintMap): Boolean { }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For example, for the above report call, the corresponding
implementation of `filterIncident` looks like this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
    override fun filterIncident(context: Context, incident: Incident, map: LintMap): Boolean {
        if (context.mainProject.targetSdk < 19) return true
        if (map.getBoolean(KEY_IMPLICIT, false) == true && context.mainProject.targetSdk >= 31) return true
        return map.getBoolean(KEY_OVERRIDES, false) == false
    }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note also that you are allowed to modify incidents here before
reporting them. The most common reason scenario for this is changing
the incident message, perhaps to reflect data not known at module
analysis time. For example, lint's API check creates messages like this:

*Error: Cast from AudioFormat to Parcelable requires API level 24 (current min is 21)*

At module analysis time when the incident was created, the minSdk being
21 was not known (and in fact can vary if this library is consumed by
many different app modules!)

!!! WARNING
   You must store state in the lint map; don't try to store it in the
   detector itself as instance state. That won't work because the
   detector instance that `filterInstance` is called on is not the same
   instance as the one which originally reported it. If you think about
   it, that makes sense; when module results are cached, the same
   reported data can be used over and over again for repeated builds,
   each time for new detector instances in the reporting task.

## Module LintMaps

The last (and most involved) scenario for partial analysis is one where
you cannot just create incidents and filter or customize them later.

The most complicated example of this is lint's built-in
[UnusedResourceDetector](https://cs.android.com/android-studio/platform/tools/base/+/mirror-goog-studio-master-dev:lint/libs/lint-checks/src/main/java/com/android/tools/lint/checks/UnusedResourceDetector.java), which locates unused resources. This “requires”
global analysis, since we want to include all resources in the entire
project. We also cannot just store lists of “resources declared” and
"resources referenced“ since we really want to treat this as a graph.
For example if `@layout/main` is including `@drawable/icon`, then a
naive approach would see the icon as referenced (by main) and therefore
mark it as not unused. But what we want is that if the icon is **only**
referenced from main, and if main is unused, then so is the icon.

To handle this, we model the resources as a graph, with edges
representing references.

When analyzing individual modules, we create the resource graph for
just that model, and we store that in the results. That means we store
it in the module's `LintMap`. This is a map for the whole module
maintained by lint, so you can access it repeatedly and add to it.
(This is also where lint's API check stores the `SDK_INT` comparison
functions as described earlier in this chapter).

The unused resource detector creates a persistence string for the
graph, and records that in the map.

Then, during reporting, it is given access to *all* the lint maps for
all the modules that the reporting module depends on, including itself.
It then merges all the graphs into a single reference graph.

For example, let's say in module 1 we have layout A which includes
drawables B and D, and B in turn depends on color C. We get a resource
graph like the following:

**********************************************
*                                            *
*    .-.        .-.        .-.               *
*   | A +----->| B +----->| C |              *
*    '+'        '-'        '-'               *
*     |                                      *
*     |                                      *
*     |     .-.                              *
*     +--->| D |                             *
*           '-'                              *
*                                            *
**********************************************

Then in another module, we have the following resource reference graph:

**********************************************
*                                            *
*    .-.        .-.        .-.               *
*   | E +----->| B +----->| D |              *
*    '-'        '-'        '-'               *
*                                            *
**********************************************

In the reporting task, we merge the two graphs like the following:

**********************************************
*                                            *
*               .-.                          *
*              | E |                         *
*               '+'                          *
*                |                           *
*                v                           *
*    .-.        .-.        .-.               *
*   | A +----->| B +----->| C |              *
*    '+'        '+'        '-'               *
*     |          |                           *
*     |          v                           *
*     |         .-.                          *
*     +------->| D |                         *
*               '-'                          *
*                                            *
**********************************************

Once that's done, it can proceed precisely as before: analyze the graph
and report all the resources that are not reachable from the reference
roots (e.g. manifest and used code).

The way this works in code is that you report data into the module by
first looking up the module data map, by calling this method on the
`Context`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
    /**
     * Returns a [PartialResult] where state can be stored for later
     * analysis. This is a more general mechanism for reporting
     * provisional issues when you need to collect a lot of data and do
     * some post processing before figuring out what to report and you
     * can't enumerate out specific [Incident] occurrences up front.
     *
     * Note that in this case, the lint infrastructure will not
     * automatically look up the error location (since there isn't one
     * yet) to see if the issue has been suppressed (via annotations,
     * lint.xml and other mechanisms), so you should do this
     * yourself, via the various [LintDriver.isSuppressed] methods.
     */
    fun getPartialResults(issue: Issue): PartialResult { ... }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then you put whatever data you want, such as the resource usage model
encoded as a string.

!!!
   Note that you don't have to worry about clashes in key names; each
   issue (and therefore detector) is given its own map.

And then your detector should also override the following method, where
you can walk through the map contents, compute incidents and report
them:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
    /**
     * Callback to detectors that add partial results (by adding entries
     * to the map returned by [LintClient.getPartialResults]). This is
     * where the data should be analyzed and merged and results reported
     * (via [Context.report]) to lint.
     */
    open fun checkPartialResults(context: Context, partialResults: PartialResult) { ... }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Optimizations

Most lint checks run on the fly in the IDE editor as well. In some
cases, if all the map computations are expensive, you can check whether
partial analysis is in effect, and if not, just directly access (for
example) the main project.

Do this by calling `isGlobalAnalysis()`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
   if (context.isGlobalAnalysis()) {
       // shortcut
   } else {
       // partial analysis code path
