# Test Modes

Lint's unit testing machinery has special support for “test modes”,
where it repeats a unit test under different conditions and makes sure
the test continues to pass with the same test results -- the same
warnings in the same test files.

There are a number of built-in test modes:

* Test modes which makes small tweaks to the source files which
  should be compatible, such as
  * Inserting unnecessary parentheses
  * Replacing imported symbols with fully qualified names
  * Replacing imported symbols with Kotlin import aliases
  * Replacing types with typealiases
  * Reordering Kotlin named arguments
  * Replacing simple functions with Kotlin expression bodies
  * etc
* A test mode which changes that detectors are correctly handling
  Kotlin literal expressions by running them both with and without
  the upcoming UiInjectionHost mode which will change the
  representation of strings in an upcoming Kotlin version
* A partial analysis test mode which runs the tests in “partial
  analysis” mode; two phases, analysis and reporting, with
  minSdkVersion set to 1 during analysis and set to the true test
  value during reporting etc.
* Bytecode Only: Any test files that specify both source and bytecode
  will only use the bytecode
* Source Only: Any test files that specify both source and bytecode
  will only use the source code

These are built-in test modes which will be applied to all detector
tests, but you can opt out of any test modes by invoking the
`skipTestModes` DSL method, as described below.

You can also add in your own test modes. For example, lint adds its own
internal test mode for making sure the built-in annotation checks works
with Android platform annotations in the following test mode:

[](https://cs.android.com/android-studio/platform/tools/base/+/mirror-goog-studio-main:lint/libs/lint-tests/src/test/java/com/android/tools/lint/checks/AndroidPlatformAnnotationsTestMode.kt)

## How to debug

Let's say you have a test failure in a particular test mode, such
as `TestMode.PARENTHESIZED` which inserts unnecessary parentheses
into the source code to make sure detectors are properly skipping
through `UParenthesizedExpression` nodes.

If you just run this under the debugger, lint will run through
all the test modes as usual, which means you'll need to skip
through a lot of intermediate breakpoint hits.

For these scenarios, it's helpful to limit the test run to **only** the
target test mode. To do this, go and specify that specific test mode as
part of the run setup by adding the following method declaration into
your detector class:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
override fun lint(): TestLintTask {
    return super.lint().testModes(TestMode.PARENTHESIZED)
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now when you run your test, it will run *only* this test mode, so you
can set breakpoints and start debugging through the scenario without
having to figure out which mode you're currently being invoked in.

!!! Warning
   Don't forget to remove that override when you're done!

## Handling Intentional Failures

There are cases where your lint check is doing something very
particular related to the changes made by the test mode which means
that the test mode doesn't really apply. For example, there is a test
mode which adds unnecessary parentheses, to make sure that the detector
is properly handling the case where there are intermediate parenthesis
nodes in the AST. Normally, every lint check should behave the same
whether or not optional parentheses are present. But, if the lint check
you are writing is actually parenthesis specific, such as suggesting
removal of optional parentheses, then obviously in that case you don't
want to apply this test mode.

To do this, there's a special test DSL method you can add,
`skipTestModes`. Adding a comment for why that particular mode is
skipped is useful as well.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
lint().files(...)
    .allowCompilationErrors()
    // When running multiple passes of lint each pass will warn
    // about the obsolete lint checks; that's fine
    .skipTestModes(TestMode.PARTIAL)
    .run()
    .expectClean()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Source-Modifying Test Modes

The most powerful test modes are those that make some deliberate
transformations to your source code, to test variations of the code
patterns that may appear in the wild. Examples of this include having
optional parentheses, or fully qualified names.

Lint will make these transformations, then run your tests on the
modified sources, and make sure the results are the same -- except for
the part of the output which shows the relevant source code, since that
part is expected to differ due to the modifications.

When lint finds a failure, it will abort with a diff that includes not
just the different error output between the default mode and the source
modifying mode, but the source files as well; that makes it easier to
spot what the difference is.

In the following screenshot for example we've run a failing test inside
IntelliJ, and have then clicked on the Show Difference link in the test
output window (Ctrl+D or Cmd-D) which shows the test failure diff
nicely:

![Figure [fqn]: Screenshot of test failure](fully-qualified-error.png)

This is a test mode which converts all symbols to fully qualified
names; in addition to the labeled output at the top we can see the
diffs in the test case files below the error output diff. The test
files include line numbers to help make it easy to correlate extra or
missing warnings with their line numbers to the changed source code.

### Fully Qualified Names

The `TestMode.FULLY_QUALIFIED` test mode will rewrite the source files
such that all symbols that it can resolve are replaced with fully
qualified names.

For example, this mode will convert the following code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
import android.widget.RemoteViews

fun test(packageName: String, other: Any) {
    val rv = RemoteViews(packageName, R.layout.test)
    val ov = other as RemoteViews
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

to

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
import android.widget.RemoteViews

fun test(packageName: String, other: Any) {
    val rv = android.widget.RemoteViews(packageName, R.layout.test)
    val ov = other as android.widget.RemoteViews
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This makes sure that your detector handles not only the case where a
symbol appears in its normal imported state, but also when it is fully
qualified in the code, perhaps because there is a different competing
class of the same name.

This will typically catch cases where the code is incorrectly just
comparing the identifier at the call node instead of the fully
qualified name.

For example, one detector's tests failed in this mode because
it was looking to identify references to an `EnumSet`,
and the code looked like this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
private fun checkEnumSet(node: UCallExpression) {
    val receiver = node.receiver
    if (receiver is USimpleNameReferenceExpression &&
        receiver.identifier == "EnumSet"
    ) {
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

which will work for code such as `EnumSet.of()` but not
`java.util.EnumSet.of()`.

Instead, use something like this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
private fun checkEnumSet(node: UCallExpression) {
    val targetClass = node.resolve()?.containingClass?.qualifiedName
        ?: return
    if (targetClass == "java.util.EnumSet") {
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As with all the source transforming test modes, there are cases where
it doesn't apply. For example, lint had a built-in check for camera
EXIF metadata, encouraging you to import the androidx version of the
library instead of using the built-in version. If it sees you using the
platform one it will normally encourage you to import the androidx one
instead:

```
src/test/pkg/ExifUsage.java:9: Warning: Avoid using android.media.ExifInterface; use androidx.exifinterface.media.ExifInterface instead [ExifInterface]
        android.media.ExifInterface exif = new android.media.ExifInterface(path);
        ---------------------------
```

However, if you explicitly (via fully qualified imports) reference the
platform one, in that case the lint check does not issue any warnings
since it figures you're deliberately trying to use the older version.
And in this test mode, the results between the two obviously differ,
and that's fine; as usual we'll deliberately turn off the check in this
detector:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~java
@Override protected TestLintTask lint() {
    // This lint check deliberately treats fully qualified imports
    // differently (they are interpreted as a deliberate usage of
    // the discouraged API) so the fully qualified equivalence test
    // does not apply:
    return super.lint().skipTestModes(TestMode.FULLY_QUALIFIED);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

!!! Tip
   In Kotlin code, you may have code that checks to see if a node is a
   `UCallExpression`. But note that if a call is fully qualified, the
   node will be a `UQualifiedReferenceExpression` instead, and you'll
   need to look at its selector. So watch out for code which does
   something like `node as? UCallExpression`.

### Import Aliasing

In Kotlin, you can create an import alias, which lets you refer to
the imported class using an entirely different name.

This test mode will create import aliases for all the import statements
in the file and will replace all the references to the import aliases
instead. This makes sure that the detector handles the equivalent Kotlin
code.

For example, this mode will convert the following code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
import android.widget.RemoteViews

fun test(packageName: String, other: Any) {
    val rv = RemoteViews(packageName, R.layout.test)
    val ov = other as RemoteViews
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

to

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
import android.widget.RemoteViews as IMPORT_ALIAS_1_REMOTEVIEWS

fun test(packageName: String, other: Any) {
    val rv = IMPORT_ALIAS_1_REMOTEVIEWS(packageName, R.layout.test)
    val ov = other as IMPORT_ALIAS_1_REMOTEVIEWS
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Type Aliasing

Kotlin also lets you alias types using the `typealias` keyword.
This test mode is similar to import aliasing, but applied to all
types. In addition to the different AST representations of import
aliases and type aliases, they apply to different things.

For example, if we import TreeMap, and we have a code reference such as
`TreeMap<String>`, then the import alias will alias the tree map class
itself, and the reference would look like `IMPORT_ALIAS_1<String>`,
whereas for type aliases, the alias would be for the whole
`TreeMap<String>`, and the code reference would be `TYPE_ALIAS_1`.

Also, import aliases will only apply to the explicitly imported
classes, whereas type aliases will apply to all types, including Int,
Boolean, List<String>, etc.

For example, this mode will convert the following code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
import android.widget.RemoteViews

fun test(packageName: String, other: Any) {
    val rv = RemoteViews(packageName, R.layout.test)
    val ov = other as RemoteViews
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

to

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
import android.widget.RemoteViews

fun test(packageName: TYPE_ALIAS_1, other: TYPE_ALIAS_2) {
    val rv = RemoteViews(packageName, R.layout.test)
    val ov = other as TYPE_ALIAS_3
}
typealias TYPE_ALIAS_1 = String
typealias TYPE_ALIAS_2 = Any
typealias TYPE_ALIAS_3 = RemoteViews
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Parenthesis Mode

Kotlin and Java code is allowed to contain extra clarifying
parentheses. Sometimes these are leftovers from earlier more
complicated expressions where when the expression was simplified the
parentheses were left in place.

In UAST, parentheses are represented in the AST (via a
`UParenthesizedExpression` node). While this is good since it allows
you to for example write lint checks which identifies unnecessary
parentheses, it introduces a complication: you can't just look at a
node's parent to for example see if it's a `UQualifiedExpression`; you
have to be prepared to look “through” it such that if it's a
`UParenthesizedExpression` node, you instead look at its parent in
turn. (And programmers can of course put as (((many unnecessary)))
parentheses as they want, so you may have to skip through repeated
nodes.)

Note also that this isn't just for looking upwards or outwards at
parents. Let's say you're looking at a call and you want to see if the
last argument is a literal expression such as a number or a String. You
*can't* just use `if (call.valueArguments.lastOrNull() is
ULiteralExpression)`, because that first argument could be a
`UParenthesizedExpression`, as in `call(1, true, ("hello")), so you'd
need to look inside the parentheses.

UAST comes with two functions to help you handle this correctly:

* Whenever you look at the parent, make sure you surround the call with
  `skipParenthesizedExprUp(UExpression)`.

* If you are looking at a child node, use the method
  `skipParenthesizedExprDown`, an extension method on UExpression (and
  from Java import it from UastUtils).

To help catch these bugs, lint has a special test mode where it inserts
various redundant parentheses in your test code, and then makes sure
that the same errors are reported. The error output will of course
potentially vary slightly (since the source code snippets shown will
contain extra parentheses), but the test will ignore these differences
and only fail if it sees new errors reported or expected errors not
reported.

In the unlikely event that your lint check is actually doing something
parenthesis specific, you can turn off this test mode using
`.skipTestModes(TestMode.PARENTHESIZED)`.

For example, this mode will convert the following code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
(t as? String)?.plus("other")?.get(0)?.dec()?.inc()
"foo".chars().allMatch { it.dec() > 0 }.toString()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

to

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
(((((t as? String))?.plus("other"))?.get(0))?.dec())?.inc()
(("foo".chars()).allMatch { (it.dec() > 0) }).toString()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default the parenthesis mode limits itself to "likely" unnecessary
parentheses; in particular, it won't put extra parenthesis around
simple literals, like (1) or (false). You can explicitly construct
`ParenthesizedTestMode(includeUnlikely=true)` if you want additional
parentheses.

### Argument Reordering

In Kotlin, with named parameters you're allowed to pass in the
arguments in any order. To handle this correctly, detectors should
never just line up parameters and arguments and match them by index;
instead, there's a `computeArgumentMapping` method on `JavaEvaluator`
which returns a map from argument to parameter.

The argument-reordering test mode will locate all calls to Kotlin
methods, and it will then first add argument names to any parameter not
already specifying a name, and then it will shift all the arguments
around, then repeat the test. This will catch any detectors which were
incorrectly making assumptions about argument order.

(Note that the test mode will not touch methods that have vararg
parameters for now.)

For example, this mode will convert the following code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
test("test", 5, true)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

to

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
test(n = 5, z = true, s = "test")
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Body Removal

In Kotlin, you can replace

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
fun test(): List<String> {
    return if (true) listOf("hello") else emptyList()
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

with

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
fun test(): List<String> = if (true) listOf("hello") else emptyList()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that these two ASTs do not look the same; we'll only have an
`UReturnExpression` node in the first case. Therefore, you have to be
careful if your detector is just visiting `UReturnExpression`s in order
to find exit points.

The body removal test mode will identify all scenarios where it can
replace a simple function declaration with an expression body, and
will make sure that the test results are the same, to make sure detectors are handling both AST variations.

It also does one more thing: it toggled optional braces from if
expressions -- converting

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
if (x < y) { test(x+1) } else test(x+2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

to

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
if (x < y) test(x+1) else { test(x+2) }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Here it has removed the braces around the if-then body since they are
optional, and it has added braces around the if-else body since it did
not have optional braces.)

The purpose of these tweaks are similar to the expression body change:
making sure that detectors are properly handling the presence of
absence of `UBlockExpression` around the child nodes.

### If to When Replacement

In Kotlin, you can replace a series of `if`/`else` statements with a
single `when` block. These two alternative do not look the same in the
AST; `if` expressions show up as `UIfExpression`, and `when`
expressions show up as `USwitchExpression`.

The if-to-when test mode will change all the `if` statements in Kotlin
lint tests with the corresponding when statement, and makes sure that
the test results remain the same. This ensures that detectors are
properly looking for both `UIfExpression` and `USwitchExpression` and
handling each. When this test mode was introduced, around 12 unit tests
in lint's built-in checks (spread across 5 detectors) needed some
tweaks.

### Whitespace Mode

This test mode inserts a number of "unnecessary" whitespace characters
in valid places in the source code.

This helps catch bugs where lint checks are improperly making
assumptions about whitespace in the source file, particularly in
quickfix implementations, or when for example looking up a qualified
expression and just taking the `asSourceString()` or `text` property of
a PSI element or PSI type and checking it for equality with something
like `java.util.List<String>`.

For example, some of the built-in checks which performed quickfix
string replacements based on regular expression matching had to be
updated to be prepared for whitespace characters:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~diff

@@ -454,7 +454,7 @@ public class WakelockDetector extends Detector implements ClassScanner, SourceCo

                     .build();
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### CDATA Mode

When declaring string resources, you may want to use XML CDATA sections
instead of plain text. For example, instead of

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~xml
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;resources&gt;
    &lt;string name="app_name"&gt;Application Name&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/resources&gt;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

you can equivalently use

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~xml
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;resources&gt;
    &lt;string name="app_name"&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Application Name]]&gt;&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/resources&gt;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(where you can place newlines and other unescaped text inside the bracketed span.)

This alternative form shows up differently in the XML DOM that is
provided to lint detectors; in particular, if you are iterating through
the `Node` children of an `Element`, you should not just look at nodes
with `nodeType == Node.TEXT_NODE`; you need to also handle `noteType ==
Node.CDATA_SECTION_NODE`.

This test mode will automatically retry all your tests that define
string resources, and will convert regular text into `CDATA` and makes
sure the results continue to be the same.

### Suppressible Mode

Users should be able to ignore lint warnings by inserting suppress annotations
(in Kotlin and Java), and via `tools:ignore` attributes in XML files.

This normally works for simple checks, but if you are combining results from
different parts of the code, or for example caching locations and reporting
them later, this is sometimes broken.

This test mode looks at the reported warnings from your unit tests, and then
for each one, it looks up the corresponding error location's source file, and
inserts a suppress directive at the nearest applicable location. It then
re-runs the analysis, and makes sure that the warning no longer appears.
