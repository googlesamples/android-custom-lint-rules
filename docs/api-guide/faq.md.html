# Frequently Asked Questions

This chapter contains a random collection of questions people
have asked in the past.

### My detector callbacks aren't invoked

If you've for example implemented the Detector callback for visiting
method calls, `visitMethodCall`, notice how the third parameter is a
`PsiMethod`, and that it is not nullable:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    open fun visitMethodCall(
        context: JavaContext,
        node: UCallExpression,
        method: PsiMethod
    ) {
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This passes in the method that has been called. When lint is visiting
the AST, it will resolve calls, and if the called method cannot be
resolved, the callback won't be called.

This happens when the classpath that lint has been configured with does
not contain everything needed. When lint is running from Gradle, this
shouldn't happen; the build system should have a complete classpath and
pass it to Lint (or the build wouldn't have succeeded in the first
place).

This usually comes up in unit tests for lint, where you've added a test
case which is referencing some API for some library, but the library
itself isn't part of the test. The solution for this is to create stubs
for the part of the API you care about. This is discussed in more
detail in the [unit testing](unit-testing.md.html) chapter.

### My lint check works from the unit test but not in the IDE

There are several things to check if you have a lint check which
works correctly from your unit test but not in the IDE.

1. First check that the lint jar is packaged correctly; use `jar tvf
   lint.jar` to look at the jar file to make sure it contains the
   service loader registration of your issue registry, and `javap
   -classpath lint.jar com.example.YourIssueRegistry` to inspect your
   issue registry.

2. If that's correct, the next thing to check is that lint is actually
   loading your issue registry. First look in the IDE log (from the
   Help menu) to make sure there aren't log messages from lint
   explaining why it can't load the registry, for example because it
   does not specify a valid applicable API range.

3. If there's no relevant warning in the log, try setting the
   `$ANDROID_LINT_JARS` environment variable to point directly to your
   lint jar file and restart Studio to make sure that that works.

4. Next, try running **Analyze | Inspect Code...**. This runs lint on
   the whole project. If that works, then the issue is that your lint
   check isn't eligible to run “on the fly”; the reason for this is
   that your implementation scope registers more than one scope, which
   says that your lint check can only run if lint gets to look at both
   types of files, and in the editor, only the current file is analyzed
   by lint. However, you can still make the check work on the fly by
   specifying additional analysis scopes; see the API guide for more
   information about this.

### `visitAnnotationUsage` isn't called for annotations

If you want to just visit any annotation declarations (e.g. `@Foo` on
method `foo`), don't use the `applicableAnnotations` and
`visitAnnotationUsage` machinery. The purpose of that facility is to
look at *elements* that are being combined with annotated elements,
such as a method call to a method whose return value has been
annotated, or an argument to a method a method parameter that has been
annotated, or assigning an assigned value to an annotated variable, etc.

If you just want to look at annotations, use `getApplicableUastTypes`
with `UAnnotation::class.java`, and a `UElementHandler` which overrides
`visitAnnotation`.

### How do I check if a UAST or PSI element is for Java or Kotlin?

To check whether an element is in Java or Kotlin, call one
of the package level methods in the detector API (and from
Java, you can access them as utility methods on the “Lint”
class) :

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
package com.android.tools.lint.detector.api

/** Returns true if the given element is written in Java. */
fun isJava(element: PsiElement?): Boolean { /* ... */ }

/** Returns true if the given language is Kotlin. */
fun isKotlin(language: Language?): Boolean { /* ... */ }

/** Returns true if the given language is Java. */
fun isJava(language: Language?): Boolean { /* ... */ }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a `UElement` and need a `PsiElement` for the above method,
see the next question.

### What if I need a `PsiElement` and I have a `UElement` ?

If you have a `UElement`, you can get the underlying source PSI element
by calling `element.sourcePsi`.

### How do I get the `UMethod` for a `PsiMethod` ?

Call `psiMethod.toUElementOfType<UMethod>()`. Note that this may return
null if UAST cannot find valid Java or Kotlin source code for the
method.

For `PsiField` and `PsiClass` instances use the equivalent
`toUElementOfType` type arguments.

### How do get a `JavaEvaluator` ?

The `Context` passed into most of the `Detector` callback methods
relevant to Kotlin and Java analysis is of type `JavaContext`, and it
has a public `evaluator` property which provides a `JavaEvaluator` you
can use in your analysis.

If you need one outside of that scenario (this is not common) you can
construct one directly by instantiating a `DefaultJavaEvaluator`; the
constructor parameters are nullable, and are only needed for a couple
of operations on the evaluator.

### How do I check whether an element is internal?

First get a `JavaEvaluator` as explained above, then call
this evaluator method:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
open fun isInternal(owner: PsiModifierListOwner?): Boolean { /* ... */
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(Note that a `PsiModifierListOwner` is an interface which includes
`PsiMethod`, `PsiClass`, `PsiField`, `PsiMember`, `PsiVariable`, etc.)

### Is element inline, sealed, operator, infix, suspend, data?

Get the `JavaEvaluator` as explained above, and then call one of these
evaluator method:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
open fun isData(owner: PsiModifierListOwner?): Boolean { /* ... */
open fun isInline(owner: PsiModifierListOwner?): Boolean { /* ... */
open fun isLateInit(owner: PsiModifierListOwner?): Boolean { /* ... */
open fun isSealed(owner: PsiModifierListOwner?): Boolean { /* ... */
open fun isOperator(owner: PsiModifierListOwner?): Boolean { /* ... */
open fun isInfix(owner: PsiModifierListOwner?): Boolean { /* ... */
open fun isSuspend(owner: PsiModifierListOwner?): Boolean { /* ... */
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### How do I look up a class if I have its fully qualified name?

Get the `JavaEvaluator` as explained above, then call
`evaluator.findClass(qualifiedName: String)`. Note that the result is
nullable.

### How do I look up a class if I have a PsiType?

Get the `JavaEvaluator` as explained above, then call
`evaluator.getTypeClass`. To go from a class to its type,
use `getClassType`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
    abstract fun getClassType(psiClass: PsiClass?): PsiClassType?
    abstract fun getTypeClass(psiType: PsiType?): PsiClass?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### How do I look up hierarhcy annotations for an element?

You can directly look up annotations via the modified list
of PsiElement or the annotations for a `UAnnotated` element,
but if you want to search the inheritance hierarchy for
annotations (e.g. if a method is overriding another, get
any annotations specified on super implementations), use
one of these two evaluator methods:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
    abstract fun getAllAnnotations(
        owner: UAnnotated,
        inHierarchy: Boolean
    ): List<UAnnotation>

    abstract fun getAllAnnotations(
        owner: PsiModifierListOwner,
        inHierarchy: Boolean
    ): Array<PsiAnnotation>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### How do I look up if a class is a subclass of another?

To see if a method is a direct member of a particular
named class, use the following method in `JavaEvaluator`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
fun isMemberInClass(member: PsiMember?, className: String): Boolean { }
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To see if a method is a member in any *subclass* of a named class, use

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~kotlin
    open fun isMemberInSubClassOf(
        member: PsiMember,
        className: String,
        strict: Boolean = false
    ): Boolean { /* ... */ }

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here, use `strict = true` if you don't want to include members in the
named class itself as a match.

To see if a class extends another or implements an interface, use one
of these methods. Again, `strict` controls whether we include the super
class or super interface itself as a match.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    abstract fun extendsClass(
        cls: PsiClass?,
        className: String,
        strict: Boolean = false
    ): Boolean

    abstract fun implementsInterface(
        cls: PsiClass,
        interfaceName: String,
        strict: Boolean = false
    ): Boolean
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### How do I know which parameter a call argument corresponds to?

In Java, matching up the arguments in a call with the parameters in the
called method is easy: the first argument corresponds to the first
parameter, the second argument corresponds to the second parameter and
so on. If there are more arguments than parameters, the last arguments
are all vararg arguments to the last parameter.

In Kotlin, it's much more complicated. With named parameters, but
arguments can appear in any order, and with default parameters, only
some of them may be specified. And if it's an extension method, the
first argument passed to a `PsiMethod` is actually the instance itself.

Lint has a utility method to help with this on the `JavaEvaluator`:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    open fun computeArgumentMapping(
        call: UCallExpression,
        method: PsiMethod
    ): Map<UExpression, PsiParameter> { /* ... */
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This returns a map from UAST expressions (each argument to a UAST call
is a `UExpression`, and these are the `valueArguments` property on the
`UCallExpression`) to each corresponding `PsiParameter` on the
`PsiMethod` that the method calls.

### How can my lint checks target two different versions of lint?

If you need to ship different versions of your lint checks to target
different versions of lint (because perhaps you need to work both with
an older version of lint, and a newer version that has a different
API), the way to do this (as of Lint 7.0) is to use the `maxApi`
property on the `IssueRegistry`. In the service loader registration
(`META-INF/services`), register *two* issue registries; one for each
implementation, and mark the older one with the right `minApi` to
`maxApi` range, and the newer one with `minApi` following the previous
registry's `maxApi`. (Both `minApi` and `maxApi` are inclusive). When
lint loads the issue registries it will ignore registries with a range
outside of the current API level.

### Can I make my lint check “not suppressible?”

In some (hopefully rare) cases, you may want your lint checks to not be
suppressible using the normal mechanisms -- suppress annotations,
comments, lint.xml files, baselines, and so on. The usecase for this is
typically strict company guidelines around compliance or security and
you want to remove the easy possibility of just silencing the check.

This is possible as part of the issue registration. After creating your
`Issue`, set the `suppressNames` property to an **empty** collection.

### How do I check out the current lint source code?
