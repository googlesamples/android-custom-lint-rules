# Terminology

You don't need to read this up front and understand everything, but
this is hopefully a handy reference to return to.

In alphabetical order:

Configuration
: A configuration provides extra information or parameters to lint on a
  per project, or even per directory basis. For example, the `lint.xml`
  files can change the severity for issues, or list incidents to ignore
  (matched for example by a regular expression), or even provide values
  for options read by a specific detector.

Context
: An object passed into detectors in many APIs, providing data about
  (for example) which file is being analyzed (and in which project),
  and for specific types of analysis additional information; for
  example, an XmlContext points to the DOM document, a JavaContext
  includes the AST, and so on.

Detector
: The implementation of the lint check which registers Issues, analyzes
  the code, and reports Incidents.

Implementation
: An `Implementation` tells lint how a given issue is actually
  analyzed, such as which detector class to instantiate, as well as
  which scopes the detector applies to.

Incident
: A specific occurrence of the issue at a specific location.
  An example of an incident is:
  ```text
      Warning: In file IoUtils.kt, line 140, the field download folder
      is "/sdcard/downloads"; do not hardcode the path to `/sdcard`.
  ```

Issue
: A type or class of problem that your lint check identifies. An issue
  has an associated severity (error, warning or info), a priority, a
  category, an explanation, and so on.

  An example of an issue is “Don't hardcode paths to /sdcard”.

IssueRegistry
: An `IssueRegistry` provides a list of issues to lint. When you write
  one or more lint checks, you'll register these in an `IssueRegistry`
  and point to it using the `META-INF` service loader mechanism.

LintClient
: The `LintClient` represents the specific tool the detector is running
  in. For example, when running in the IDE there is a LintClient which
  (when incidents are reported) will show highlights in the editor,
  whereas when lint is running as part of the Gradle plugin, incidents
  are instead accumulated into HTML (and XML and text) reports, and
  the build interrupted on error.

Location
: A “location” refers to a place where an incident is reported.
  Typically this refers to a text range within a source file, but a
  location can also point to a binary file such as a `png` file.
  Locations can also be linked together, along with descriptions.
  Therefore, if you for example are reporting a duplicate declaration,
  you can include **both** Locations, and in the IDE, both locations
  (if they're in the same file) will be highlighted. A location linked
  from another is called a “secondary” location, but the chaining can
  be as long as you want (and lint's unit testing infrastructure will
  make sure there are no cycles.)

Partial Analysis
: A “map reduce” architecture in lint which makes it possible to
  analyze individual modules in isolation and then later filter and
  customize the partial results based on conditions outside of these
  modules. This is explained in greater detail in the
  [partial analysis](partial-analysis.md.html) chapter.

Platform
: The `Platform` abstraction allows lint issues to indicate where they
  apply (such as “Android”, or “Server”, and so on). This means that an
  Android-specific check won't trigger warnings on non-Android code.

Scanner
: A `Scanner` is a particular interface a detector can implement to
  indicate that it supports a specific set of callbacks. For example,
  the `XmlScanner` interface is where the methods for visiting XML
  elements and attributes are defined, and the `ClassScanner` is where
  the ASM bytecode handling methods are defined, and so on.

Scope
: `Scope` is an enum which lists various types of files that a detector
  may want to analyze.

  For example, there is a scope for XML files, there is a scope for
  Java and Kotlin files, there is a scope for .class files, and so on.

  Typically lint cares about which **set** of scopes apply,
  so most of the APIs take an `EnumSet< Scope>`, but we'll often
  refer to this as just “the scope” instead of the “scope set”.

Severity
: For an issue, whether the incident should be an error, or just a
  warning, or neither (just an FYI highlight). There is also a special
  type of error severity, “fatal”, discussed later.

TextFormat
: An enum describing various text formats lint understands. Lint checks
  will typically only operate with the “raw” format, which is
  markdown-like (e.g. you can surround words with an asterisk to make
  it italics or two to make it bold, and so on).

Vendor
: A `Vendor` is a simple data class which provides information about
  the provenance of a lint check: who wrote it, where to file issues,
  and so on.
