# Publishing a Lint Check

Lint will look for jar files with a service registry key for issue
registries.

You can manually point it to your custom lint checks jar files by using
the environment variable `ANDROID_LINT_JARS`:

```shell
$ export ANDROID_LINT_JARS=/path/to/first.jar:/path/to/second.jar
```
(On Windows, use `;` instead of `:` as the path separator)

However, that is only intended for development and as a workaround for
build systems that do not have direct support for lint or embedded lint
libraries, such as the internal Google build system.

## Android

### AAR Support

Android libraries are shipped as `.aar` files instead of `.jar` files.
This means that they can carry more than just the code payload. Under
the hood, `.aar` files are just zip files which contain many other
nested files, including api and implementation jars, resources,
proguard/r8 rules, and yes, lint jars.

For example, if we look at the contents of the timber logging library's
AAR file, we can see the lint.jar with several lint checks within as
part of the payload:

```shell
$ jar tvf ~/.gradle/caches/.../jakewharton.timber/timber/4.5.1/?/timber-4.5.1.aar
   216 Fri Jan 20 14:45:28 PST 2017 AndroidManifest.xml
  8533 Fri Jan 20 14:45:28 PST 2017 classes.jar
 10111 Fri Jan 20 14:45:28 PST 2017 lint.jar
    39 Fri Jan 20 14:45:28 PST 2017 proguard.txt
     0 Fri Jan 20 14:45:24 PST 2017 aidl/
     0 Fri Jan 20 14:45:28 PST 2017 assets/
     0 Fri Jan 20 14:45:28 PST 2017 jni/
     0 Fri Jan 20 14:45:28 PST 2017 res/
     0 Fri Jan 20 14:45:28 PST 2017 libs/
```

The advantage of this approach is that when lint notices that you
depend on a library, and that library contains custom lint checks, then
lint will pull in those checks and apply them. This gives library
authors a way to provide their own additional checks enforcing usage.

### lintPublish Configuration

The Android Gradle library plugin provides some special configurations,
`lintConfig` and `lintPublish`.

The `lintPublish` configuration lets you reference another project, and
it will take that project's output jar and package it as a `lint.jar`
inside the AAR file.

The [](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-custom-lint-rules)
sample project demonstrates this setup.

The `:checks` project is a pure Kotlin library which depends on the
Lint APIs, implements a `Detector`, and provides an `IssueRegistry`
which is linked from `META-INF/services`.

Then in the Android library, the `:library` project applies the Android
Gradle library plugin. It then specifies a `lintPublish` configuration
referencing the checks lint project:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
apply plugin: 'com.android.library'
dependencies {
    lintPublish project(':checks')
    // other dependencies
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, the sample `:app` project is an example of an Android app
which depends on the library, and the source code in the app contains a
violation of the lint check defined in the `:checks` project. If you
run `./gradlew :app:lint` to analyze the app, the build will fail
emitting the custom lint check.

### Local Checks

What if you aren't publishing a library, but you'd like to apply
some checks locally for your own codebase?

You can use a similar approach to `lintPublish`: In your app
module, specify

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
dependencies {
    lintConfig project(':checks')
    // other dependencies
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now, when lint runs on this application, it will apply the checks
provided from the given project.

!!! Warning
   This mechanism works well on the CI server for enforcing local code
   conventions, and it also works for developers on your team; the
   errors should be flagged in the IDE (providing they are analyzing
   single-file scopes). However, there have been various bugs and
   difficulties around the lint checks getting rebuilt after changes or
   clean builds. There are some bugs in the Android Gradle Plugin issue
   tracker for this.

### Unpublishing

If you end up “deleting” a lint check, perhaps because the original
conditions for the lint check are not true, don't just stop
distributing lint checks with your library. Instead, you'll want to
update your `IssueRegistry` to override the `deletedIssues` property to
return your deleted issue id or ids:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/**
 * The issue id's from any issues that have been deleted from this
 * registry. This is here such that when an issue no longer applies
 * and is no longer registered, any existing mentions of the issue
 * id in baselines, lint.xml files etc are gracefully handled.
 */
open val deletedIssues: List<String> = emptyList()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The reason you'll want to do this is listed right there in the doc: If
you don't do this, and if users have for example listed your issue id
in their `build.gradle` file or in `lint.xml` to say change the
severity, then lint will report an error that it's an unknown id. This
is done to catch issue id typos. And if the user has a baseline file
listing incidents from your check, then if your issue id is not
registered as deleted, lint will think this is an issue that has been
"fixed“ since it's no longer reported, and lint will issue an
informational message that the baseline contains issues no longer
reported (which is done such that users can update their baseline
files, to ensure that the fixed issues aren't reintroduced again.)
