(#) Duplicate Platform Classes

!!! ERROR: Duplicate Platform Classes
   This is an error, and is also enforced at build time when
   supported by the build system. For Android this means it will
   run during release builds.

There are a number of libraries that duplicate not just functionality of
the Android platform but using the exact same class names as the ones
provided in Android -- for example the apache http classes. This can
lead to unexpected crashes.

To solve this, you need to either find a newer version of the library
which no longer has this problem, or to repackage the library (and all
of its dependencies) using something like the `jarjar` tool, or finally,
rewriting the code to use different APIs (for example, for http code,
consider using `HttpUrlConnection` or a library like `okhttp`).

!!! Tip
   This lint check has an associated quickfix available in the IDE.

(##) Suppressing

You can suppress false positives using one of the following mechanisms:

* Using a suppression comment like this on the line above:

  ```kt
  //noinspection DuplicatePlatformClasses
  problematicStatement()
  ```

* Using a special `lint.xml` file in the source tree which turns off
  the check in that folder and any sub folder. A simple file might look
  like this:
  ```xml
  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
  &lt;lint&gt;
      &lt;issue id="DuplicatePlatformClasses" severity="ignore" /&gt;
  &lt;/lint&gt;
  ```
  Instead of `ignore` you can also change the severity here, for
  example from `error` to `warning`. You can find additional
  documentation on how to filter issues by path, regular expression and
  so on
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/lintxml.md.html).

* In Gradle projects, using the DSL syntax to configure lint. For
  example, you can use something like
  ```gradle
  lintOptions {
      disable 'DuplicatePlatformClasses'
  }
  ```
  In Android projects this should be nested inside an `android { }`
  block.

* For manual invocations of `lint`, using the `--ignore` flag:
  ```
  $ lint --ignore DuplicatePlatformClasses ...`
  ```

* Last, but not least, using baselines, as discussed
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/baselines.md.html).
