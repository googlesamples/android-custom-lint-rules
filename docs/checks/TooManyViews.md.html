(#) Layout has too many views

!!! WARNING: Layout has too many views
   This is a warning.

Id
:   `TooManyViews`
Summary
:   Layout has too many views
Severity
:   Warning
Category
:   Performance
Platform
:   Android
Vendor
:   Android Open Source Project
Affects
:   Resource files
Editing
:   This check runs on the fly in the IDE editor
Implementation
:   [Source Code](https://cs.android.com/android-studio/platform/tools/base/+/mirror-goog-studio-master-dev:lint/libs/lint-checks/src/main/java/com/android/tools/lint/checks/TooManyViewsDetector.java)

Using too many views in a single layout is bad for performance. Consider
using compound drawables or other tricks for reducing the number of
views in this layout.

The maximum view count defaults to 80 but can be configured with the
environment variable `ANDROID_LINT_MAX_VIEW_COUNT`.

(##) Suppressing

You can suppress false positives using one of the following mechanisms:

* Adding the suppression attribute `tools:ignore="TooManyViews"` on
  the problematic XML element (or one of its enclosing elements). You
  may also need to add the following namespace declaration on the root
  element in the XML file if it's not already there:
  `xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"`

* Using a special `lint.xml` file in the source tree which turns off
  the check in that folder and any sub folder. A simple file might look
  like this:
  ```xml
  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
  &lt;lint&gt;
      &lt;issue id="TooManyViews" severity="ignore" /&gt;
  &lt;/lint&gt;
  ```
  Instead of `ignore` you can also change the severity here, for
  example from `error` to `warning`. You can find additional
  documentation on how to filter issues by path, regular expression and
  so on
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/lintxml.md.html).

* In Gradle projects, using the DSL syntax to configure lint. For
  example, you can use something like
  ```gradle
  lintOptions {
      disable 'TooManyViews'
  }
  ```
  In Android projects this should be nested inside an `android { }`
  block.

* For manual invocations of `lint`, using the `--ignore` flag:
  ```
  $ lint --ignore TooManyViews ...`
  ```

* Last, but not least, using baselines, as discussed
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/baselines.md.html).
