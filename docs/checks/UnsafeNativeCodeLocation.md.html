(#) Native code outside library directory

!!! WARNING: Native code outside library directory
   This is a warning.

Id
:   `UnsafeNativeCodeLocation`
Summary
:   Native code outside library directory
Severity
:   Warning
Category
:   Security
Platform
:   Android
Vendor
:   Android Open Source Project
Affects
:   Kotlin and Java files
Editing
:   This check runs on the fly in the IDE editor
Implementation
:   [Source Code](https://cs.android.com/android-studio/platform/tools/base/+/mirror-goog-studio-master-dev:lint/libs/lint-checks/src/main/java/com/android/tools/lint/checks/UnsafeNativeCodeDetector.java)
Tests

In general, application native code should only be placed in the
application's library directory, not in other locations such as the res
or assets directories. Placing the code in the library directory
provides increased assurance that the code will not be tampered with
after application installation. Application developers should use the
features of their development environment to place application native
libraries into the lib directory of their compiled APKs. Embedding
non-shared library native executables into applications should be
avoided when possible.

(##) Suppressing

You can suppress false positives using one of the following mechanisms:

* Using a suppression annotation like this on the enclosing
  element:

  ```kt
  // Kotlin
  @Suppress("UnsafeNativeCodeLocation")
  fun method() {
     problematicStatement()
  }
  ```

  or

  ```java
  // Java
  @SuppressWarnings("UnsafeNativeCodeLocation")
  void method() {
     problematicStatement();
  }
  ```

* Using a suppression comment like this on the line above:

  ```kt
  //noinspection UnsafeNativeCodeLocation
  problematicStatement()
  ```

* Using a special `lint.xml` file in the source tree which turns off
  the check in that folder and any sub folder. A simple file might look
  like this:
  ```xml
  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
  &lt;lint&gt;
      &lt;issue id="UnsafeNativeCodeLocation" severity="ignore" /&gt;
  &lt;/lint&gt;
  ```
  Instead of `ignore` you can also change the severity here, for
  example from `error` to `warning`. You can find additional
  documentation on how to filter issues by path, regular expression and
  so on
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/lintxml.md.html).

* In Gradle projects, using the DSL syntax to configure lint. For
  example, you can use something like
  ```gradle
  lintOptions {
      disable 'UnsafeNativeCodeLocation'
  }
  ```
  In Android projects this should be nested inside an `android { }`
  block.

* For manual invocations of `lint`, using the `--ignore` flag:
  ```
  $ lint --ignore UnsafeNativeCodeLocation ...`
  ```

* Last, but not least, using baselines, as discussed
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/baselines.md.html).
