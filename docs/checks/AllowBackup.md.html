Implementation
:   [Source Code](https://cs.android.com/android-studio/platform/tools/base/+/mirror-goog-studio-master-dev:lint/libs/lint-checks/src/main/java/com/android/tools/lint/checks/ManifestDetector.kt)
Tests

The `allowBackup` attribute determines if an application's data can be
backed up and restored. It is documented at
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup

By default, this flag is set to `true` which means application data can
be backed up and restored by the OS. Setting `allowBackup="false"` opts
the application out of being backed up and so users can't restore data
related to it when they go through the device setup wizard.

Allowing backups may have security consequences for an application.
Currently `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to
copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application
data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of
application data from a source specified by the user. Following a
restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions,
and directory permissions were created by the application itself.

To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support
backup, and explicitly set `android:allowBackup=(true|false)"`.

If not set to false, and if targeting API 23 or later, lint will also
warn that you should set `android:fullBackupContent` or
`android:fullBackupOnly` to configure auto backup.

!!! Tip
   This lint check has an associated quickfix available in the IDE.

(##) Example

Here is an example of lint warnings produced by this check:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~text
AndroidManifest.xml:8:Warning: Should explicitly set android:allowBackup
to true or false (it's true by default, and that can have some security
implications for the application's data) [AllowBackup]

    &lt;application
     -----------

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is the source file referenced above:

`AndroidManifest.xml`:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~xml linenumbers
&lt;manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="test.bytecode"
    android:versionCode="1"
    android:versionName="1.0" &gt;

    &lt;uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="14" /&gt;

    &lt;application
        android:icon="@drawable/ic_launcher"
        android:label="@string/app_name" &gt;
    &lt;/application&gt;

&lt;/manifest&gt;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also visit the
[source code](https://cs.android.com/android-studio/platform/tools/base/+/mirror-goog-studio-master-dev:lint/libs/lint-tests/src/test/java/com/android/tools/lint/checks/ManifestDetectorTest.kt)
for the unit tests for this check to see additional scenarios.

The above example was automatically extracted from the first unit test
found for this lint check, `ManifestDetector.testAllowBackup`.

(##) Suppressing

You can suppress false positives using one of the following mechanisms:

* Adding the suppression attribute `tools:ignore="AllowBackup"` on the
  problematic XML element (or one of its enclosing elements). You may
  also need to add the following namespace declaration on the root
  element in the XML file if it's not already there:
  `xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"`

* Using a special `lint.xml` file in the source tree which turns off
  the check in that folder and any sub folder. A simple file might look
  like this:
  ```xml
  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
  &lt;lint&gt;
      &lt;issue id="AllowBackup" severity="ignore" /&gt;
  &lt;/lint&gt;
  ```
  Instead of `ignore` you can also change the severity here, for
  example from `error` to `warning`. You can find additional
  documentation on how to filter issues by path, regular expression and
  so on
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/lintxml.md.html).

* In Gradle projects, using the DSL syntax to configure lint. For
  example, you can use something like
  ```gradle
  lintOptions {
      disable 'AllowBackup'
  }
  ```
  In Android projects this should be nested inside an `android { }`
  block.

* For manual invocations of `lint`, using the `--ignore` flag:
  ```
  $ lint --ignore AllowBackup ...`
  ```

* Last, but not least, using baselines, as discussed
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/baselines.md.html).
