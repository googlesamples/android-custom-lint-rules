Android uses the letter codes ISO 639-1 for languages, and the letter
codes ISO 3166-1 for the region codes. In many cases, the language code
and the country where the language is spoken is the same, but it is also
often not the case. For example, while 'se' refers to Sweden, where
Swedish is spoken, the language code for Swedish is **not** `se` (which
refers to the Northern Sami language), the language code is `sv`. And
similarly the region code for `sv` is El Salvador.

This lint check looks for suspicious language and region combinations,
to help catch cases where you've accidentally used the wrong language or
region code. Lint knows about the most common regions where a language
is spoken, and if a folder combination is not one of these, it is
flagged as suspicious.

Note however that it may not be an error: you can theoretically have
speakers of any language in any region and want to target that with your
resources, so this check is aimed at tracking down likely mistakes, not
to enforce a specific set of region and language combinations.

(##) Example

Here is an example of lint warnings produced by this check:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~text
res/values-nb-rSE/strings.xml:Warning: Suspicious language and region
combination nb (Norwegian Bokmål) with SE (Sweden): language nb is
usually paired with: NO (Norway), SJ (Svalbard & Jan Mayen)
[WrongRegion]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is the source file referenced above:

`res/values-nb-rSE/strings.xml`:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~xml linenumbers
&lt;resources&gt;null&lt;/resources&gt;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also visit the
[source code](https://cs.android.com/android-studio/platform/tools/base/+/mirror-goog-studio-main:lint/libs/lint-tests/src/test/java/com/android/tools/lint/checks/LocaleFolderDetectorTest.kt)
for the unit tests for this check to see additional scenarios.

The above example was automatically extracted from the first unit test
found for this lint check, `LocaleFolderDetector.testSuspiciousRegion`.

(##) Suppressing

You can suppress false positives using one of the following mechanisms:

* Using a special `lint.xml` file in the source tree which turns off
  the check in that folder and any sub folder. A simple file might look
  like this:
  ```xml
  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
  &lt;lint&gt;
      &lt;issue id="WrongRegion" severity="ignore" /&gt;
  &lt;/lint&gt;
  ```
  Instead of `ignore` you can also change the severity here, for
  example from `error` to `warning`. You can find additional
  documentation on how to filter issues by path, regular expression and
  so on
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/lintxml.md.html).

* In Gradle projects, using the DSL syntax to configure lint. For
  example, you can use something like
  ```gradle
  lintOptions {
      disable 'WrongRegion'
  }
  ```
  In Android projects this should be nested inside an `android { }`
  block.

* For manual invocations of `lint`, using the `--ignore` flag:
  ```
  $ lint --ignore WrongRegion ...`
  ```

* Last, but not least, using baselines, as discussed
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/baselines.md.html).
