(#) Resource with Wrong Prefix

!!! ERROR: Resource with Wrong Prefix
   This is an error, and is also enforced at build time when
   supported by the build system. For Android this means it will
   run during release builds.

In Gradle projects you can specify a resource prefix that all resources
in the project must conform to. This makes it easier to ensure that you
don't accidentally combine resources from different libraries, since
they all end up in the same shared app namespace.

(##) Suppressing

You can suppress false positives using one of the following mechanisms:

* Adding the suppression attribute `tools:ignore="ResourceName"` on
  the problematic XML element (or one of its enclosing elements). You
  may also need to add the following namespace declaration on the root
  element in the XML file if it's not already there:
  `xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"`

* Using a special `lint.xml` file in the source tree which turns off
  the check in that folder and any sub folder. A simple file might look
  like this:
  ```xml
  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
  &lt;lint&gt;
      &lt;issue id="ResourceName" severity="ignore" /&gt;
  &lt;/lint&gt;
  ```
  Instead of `ignore` you can also change the severity here, for
  example from `error` to `warning`. You can find additional
  documentation on how to filter issues by path, regular expression and
  so on
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/lintxml.md.html).

* In Gradle projects, using the DSL syntax to configure lint. For
  example, you can use something like
  ```gradle
  lintOptions {
      disable 'ResourceName'
  }
  ```
  In Android projects this should be nested inside an `android { }`
  block.

* For manual invocations of `lint`, using the `--ignore` flag:
  ```
  $ lint --ignore ResourceName ...`
  ```

* Last, but not least, using baselines, as discussed
  [here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/usage/baselines.md.html).
