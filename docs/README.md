Android Lint
============

(Note that many files in this docs folder has the extension `.md.html`
instead of just `.md`. That means that they can be opened in a
browser for better visualization (such as syntax highlighting of code
snippets) but are readable and editable as markdown.)

Let's go there right now: [Link](README.md.html)

A (usually recent) snapshot of these docs are hosted
[here](https://googlesamples.github.io/android-custom-lint-rules/).
